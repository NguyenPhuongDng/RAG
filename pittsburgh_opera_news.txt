Season Closes with 1stPerformances of Jennifer Higdon & Jerre Dye’s Take on a Real-life Art Heist, with three Alternate Endings
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Saturday evening, the crowd that filledPittsburgh Opera’s Bitz Studioin the Strip heard the world première ofWoman With Eyes Closed, as the company gave the enigmatic “family portrait” a rousing  first performance that gave new meaning to the title. Tuesday night’s audience will hear the opera with a different conclusion and other nights a third. Advance sales created the need for an additional performance, the unusual Saturday, May 3, 2025, 2:00 PM matinee. What this and the other audiences hear will be the preview audience’s choice and even a chance at the cast’s selection.
Higdon and Dye’s work provided a fine night of genuine entertainment, and will do so until the lights dim at Pittsburgh Opera until the autumn. Briefly, when Mona – a tormented woman with true maternal instincts, finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen artworks, she must struggle with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son – the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence against her son, but one of the paintings -Lucian Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”- looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was young. “The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.” Women with eyes closed take on a new meaning.
Each time the Bitz Studio is used, designers and directors – indeed, the entire artistic team – find better ideas of how to make the most of the performing space. It was a genuine treat to see the chamber sized orchestra, high above the performing space below, with ConductorAntony Walkerhighlighted throughout. The gifted instrumentalists, lighting, projections, stage settings all combined for an entertaining evening that was...

ByGeorge B ParousonApril 19, 2025•(0)
Season Finale Opens Saturday Under ‘Veil of Mystery‘
And it doesn’t matter which of the three endings we see and hear – we’ll never tell. But we can always count onChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications forPittsburgh Opera, to share thoughts with a cast member of each new production. This time round it’sAudrey Welsh, the bright mezzo-soprano and first year Resident Artist who will finish the 2024-25 season with more high hopes for what she’s proved from the instant she set foot on the local opera stage. And the rest went something like this…
Chris Cox: Audrey Welsh, welcome! Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Where you’re from, how did you first discover you were interested in opera, and what led you to Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program?
Audrey Welsh: I’m a mezzo-soprano from Houston, Texas. I started singing because of my mom. I was dead set on making my high school volleyball team my freshman year, and that wasn’t in the cards for me. My mom said, “Hey, the choir tryouts are the same day. Here’s $5. You should go audition for the choir.” She loves to say it’s the best $5 she’s ever spent, because I ended up getting into the choir, and then I begrudgingly stayed with it all four years. By my senior year, I was choir president and captain of the varsity choir. The bug bit me again, after I took a brief hiatus from performing in middle school because I thought I was too cool. It turns out I’m not.
My senior year of high school, I auditioned for the Houston Grand Opera’s Bauer Family High School Voice Studio. That was integral in my development, and led me to pursue my Bachelor of Music in Voice. That program definitely sling-shotted me into pursuing this professionally. I just totally fell in love with seeing all of the shows at Houston Grand Opera and haven’t looked back.

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
“Spectacle” is the word. Grand opera at its best is a spectacle—a presentation that floods the concert hall with soaring music, dynamic visual effects, and dazzling stagecraft, all coming together around a heart-rending saga. The current production of Puccini’sMadama Butterflyat Pittsburgh Opera (through March 30) gives you all that, while even adding a modern twist to the underlying story.
Soprano Karah Son, small in stature but with a powerfully pristine voice, delivers a scorching portrayal of a jilted bride in the title role. (She has sung it in more than 20 stagings ofButterflyinternationally). Moreover, Puccini’s score works as well as it ever did throughout. Time and again the orchestra shifts musical gears seamlessly to convey the changing moods and tensions of the tale.
At some points you hear, briefly, the tinkling echoes of traditional Japanese melodies. But those cheerful notes are swept away by the tragic fate that envelops a young woman who trusted her heart too much. And late in the opera, as she faces mounting evidence that her faithless husband won’t be coming home again, the tone is set by a musical device guaranteed to chill any listener’s spine. Amid the plaintive strains of violins come eerie human voices—the soft and wordless wailing of an offstage chorus, as if faraway sea-sirens are chanting a lost sailor’s doom.
The Backstory: a Bridge Between Eras and Cultures
Giacomo Puccini composed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. That was a time when high-art operatic conventions were giving way to, or at least being augmented by, new artistic approaches.Madama Butterfly, which premiered in Milan in 1904, bridged the old and new memorably.
Puccini was inspired to create the opera after seeing a play adapted from the American short storyMadame Butterfly. Eventually, working with librettists Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, he arrived at the version that would become a staple of the repertoire worldwide.
The setting is Nagasaki at the turn of the 20th...

Huge Crowd on Hand for First Night of “Virtual Reality” Take on Puccini Classic
By George B. Parous
Whether it was a love of Puccini’s music, curiosity about the new production, or both, something drew the biggest opening night audience in recent memory to the Benedum for Pittsburgh Opera’sMadama Butterflylast evening. WhileMelanie Bacaling’s revival of Matthew Ozawa’s modern spin is indeed a revisionist take on the favorite opera, in the audience could be spotted a handful of patrons in traditional geisha attire. It was a fun crowd that sat silently spellbound through the entire first act before adding thunderous applause to the occasion, an ovation that was well deserved by all involved.
Much has been written and spoken of the new production, so an attempt to add anything new won’t be made here, aside from comment on the musical aspects heard last evening. One thing is certain, and that is anything but panoramic photography can’t do the staging any justice. Lighting, costumes, set design, direction – all are quite admirable and fill the entire Benedum performing space. The “virtual” aspects of the production, while obvious, aren’t enough to distract those who prefer the traditional, and the music certainly isn’t harmed in any way.
Cio-Cio-San (Karah Son) and her relatives
It was obvious from the start thatAntony Walkerand the orchestra were “on” for the night. Puccini’s rich orchestration received a lush performance. What new superlative adjectives can describe this remarkable body of musicians? UnderMark Trawka’s direction, the chorus delivered some of the most beautiful music of the entire evening. The off-stage intonements were ethereal and positively enchanting. A few of the choristers stepped forward in smaller roles, such asVeronika Schmidt(Cio-Cio-San’s Mother),Lilly Abreu(the Cousin) andChristina McCann(The Aunt), and Resident ArtistsErik Nordstrom(The Imperia...

Melanie Bacaling, Stage Director, Discusses Production
Saturday evening, March 22,Pittsburgh Operawill give this season’s first performance of Puccini’s classicMadama Butterfly. In this new production, the story is moved to a  realm “where reality and dreams intersect.”Chris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, recently took the time to discuss the production with stage directorMelanie Bacaling, and shared with us the following transcript of their conversation:
Chris Cox: Melanie Bacaling, welcome to Pittsburgh.
Melanie Bacaling: Thank you so much for having me.
CC: Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you became an Opera Stage director?
MB: That is a bit of a winding road. I am originally from Chicago. I came to opera first through the singing lens, actually. I got my undergraduate degrees in psychology and vocal performance from the University of Evansville. And then in graduate school I got my master’s in vocal pedagogy and performance, thinking I was going to go more towards the teaching and singing route, focusing on voice science and rehabilitating injured singing voices.
But while I was in grad school, I started working closely with one of the directing faculty at the Boston Conservatory, Nathan Troop. I just absolutely fell in love with being on the other side of the table, and realized that big picture storytelling was something I really had my heart and eyes on. I’d always been into theater and that kind of storytelling. So I started taking the opportunities to be in rehearsal rooms. I was sweeping and mopping the floors of the Boston Lyric Opera rehearsal rooms so I could be there observing and watching how directors and conductors and singers work and interact. And from there, I ended up getting a few opportunities to stage manage and production assist and then worked my way up into assistant direct...

“Baroque” Rarity is Being Presented With Powerful Vocal Cast in Effective Staging
By George B. Parous
Pittsburgh Operagave the second performance of Joseph Hadyn’sArmidalast evening, at theCAPAauditorium, and it was an outstanding example of the company’s commitment to presenting rarely heard music, performed by talented young singers with a first-class orchestral accompaniment. The production is mounted from the floor up by the company, and is effective, with a little imagination, in showcasing the music – probably new to most of the audience – and the music in this work is most definitely the thing. And the amount of talent available for these first local performances of Haydn’s opera is quite remarkable.
Armida (Lauryn Davis)
For brevity, the program’s capsulation of the 1784 opera will do nicely. “To prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, the Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida’s spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both?” A mighty plot for a single-set production, indeed, but again, Haydn’s music, and the performers pouring it from the stage, draw focus directly to the singers and orchestra. As is usually the case,Antony Walkerand the orchestra gave an almost seamless delivery of the opera’s beautiful orchestration.
Armida (Lauryn Davis) pleads with Rinaldo (Fran Daniel Laucerica)
In the title role, sopranoLauryn Davisis making her Pittsburgh Opera debut. She gives a fierce, commanding performance of the part, with a voice of remarkable power and quality. More than once she astonished with a brilliant...

📰 n exhilarating introduction to what this art form can offer" -- Pittsburgh Quarterly

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
The French New Wave director Francois Truffaut once remarked of Alfred Hitchcock that he was the only director who did not require sound for his films to be understood; in other words, the effect of his visual narrative was so strong that dialogue was not really necessary.  In much the same way, I found in watching–or I should say, listening to–Pittsburgh Opera’s performance of “Armida,” that I did not really need to read the English supertitles, sung in Italian, which were projected over the stage.  Because the emotional impact of this drama was self-evident in the delivery by the superb cast, such that reading the libretto took me out of the reverie of what these characters were experiencing and conveying in a musical language that did not require literal translation.That said, if you’re not an opera aficionado, this 1784 work by the Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn would be an exhilarating introduction to what this art form can offer.  You can either choose to follow the story–loosely based on a fictionalized account of a love story set during the First Crusade, as envisioned in the 1581 poemGerusalemme liberata, by Torquato Tasso–or simply recline in your seat, letting the rapture of the singers and the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra, conducted by Anthony Walker, envelope you.
Playing the title role, soprano Lauryn Davis evokes the sometimes brightly tortured, sometimes darkly ecstatic nature of her character–a sorceress sent to seduce a Christian knight–through the ethereal quality of her voice: she has the melancholic interiority of someone who just stepped out of a Caspar David Friedrich painting.  Ms. Davis captures the subtle antimony of her role–is Armida intrinsically good or evil, we’re never sure–in such a way that whenever she looks into the abyss of her existence, she tries to fill it with the light of her voice, rather than the tragedy of her despair. Brilliantly serving as the counterpart to her amorous vacillations, tenor Fran Daniel Laucerica inve...

Company Will Mount New Production With Lauryn Davis Singing the Title Role
This Saturday, January 25, at the CAPA Theater,Pittsburgh Operawill present the first local performance of Joseph Haydn’s best known work,Armida.Even the composer considered it his best work. Singing the title role will be Resident ArtistLauryn Davis, in her company debut. Ms. Davis recently was named a District Winner at the Tennessee District of the Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition.
As he always does,Chris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, kindly took time out of his hectic schedule to interview Ms. Davis exclusively for onStage Pittsburgh. And here’s the interview –
Chris Cox:
Welcome Lauryn! Could you start by telling us a little bit about yourself and how you found your way to Pittsburgh Opera?
Lauryn Davis:
I’m from Atlanta, Georgia. I started studying opera in high school. I went to Kennesaw State for my undergrad. I graduated during Covid, unfortunately, took a gap year, and then went to CCM [University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music] for my Master’s. I graduated in April 2024, then I auditioned for Pittsburgh Opera, and they gave me a call.
C C:
What did you do during your gap year?
L D:
I taught group piano lessons to kids from Kindergarten through second grade. I taught the kids keys, and it was cute. It was throughFine Arts Matter
C C:
Sounds like a great experience.Armidais going to be your company stage debut, but obviously you’ve been doing other things with Pittsburgh Opera since you arrived here in the fall. What else have you been doing since you got here?
L D:
I studied and covered Nedda inPagliacci. We’ve been doing a lot of runouts and singing engagements throughout the community, at retirement homes and Children’s Hospital and places like that. Our Holiday Song ...

Nedda (Caitlin Gotimer) cowers to the demands of her husband Canio (Jonathan Burton) who is most certainly not clowning around in ‘Pagliacci.’
As a kid, fall weekends often started with a sleepover at a friend’s house. We’d stay up too late playing board games or just horsing around in the basement. When morning came, we’d have endless bowls of sugary cereal, walk to the drugstore for candy and then go to the movies for a double feature (which also included cartoons, a serial reel, and sometimes a yo-yo contest.) In fact, I don’t recall ever going to a Saturday matinee that wasn’t a double feature. I can still remember the stop-action animation of sword-fighting skeletons attackingJason and The Argonautsor the herculean teams of Norsemen rowingThe Long Ships.Everything about Saturdays was gluttonous. Never just one bowl of Sugar Pops, not just one Clark Bar or a single Reese’s Cup, and then, always, two movies and more. What joy! What sinful gluttony!
Such is the adult thrill of experiencing two operas in one evening. Pittsburgh Opera’s double feature ofCavalleria RusticanaandPagliacciis a sweet treat for aficionados of soaring arias and serious orchestration.
Two for One
Often paired together for reasons of sharing an identical set filled with a secondary cast of common townsfolk,Cavalleria RusticanaandPagliaccialso share a style of operatic storytelling calledverismo(as in verisimilitude) in which the librettist calls on everyday characters to fulfill the tragedy soon to unfold. There are no kings or princesses to confront their deserved comeuppances; no scheming divas or aristocratic asses to suffer their certain fate. Inopera verismo,we experience the jealousy, adultery, greed and vengeance of common villagers going about their lives looking for love and, often with disastrous result, dealing with their destinies.
Cavalleria Rusticana,Pietro Mascagni’s best known opera,is the simple story of a young woman (Santuzza) whose one-time lover (Turrido) has been foolin...

Grand Performances by Singers, Orchestra, Chorus, Acrobats and More
By GEORGE B PAROUS
A good-sized crowd was on hand at the Benedum last night, whenPittsburgh Operagave the first performance of theirCavalleria RusticanaandPagliaccidouble-header production. Both operas were well worth hearing, but in fairness it must be said that the second opera came off better than the first. Still, anything conducted byAntony Walkeris grand opera at it best, and the overall impression made last night was success, richly rewarded by long sustained, hearty applause. At the final curtain of the night, the audience had more than the singers, orchestra and splendid chorus to applaud. Truly astonishing feats by acrobats and stilt-walking jugglers from theBooglepLex Circusawed the crowd and, alone, are well worth the admission price. Beautiful music, richly performed, was the atmosphere of the night, and if individual performances by any of the singers seem perfunctory, it is only due to time and space. The stage wallowed in a wealth of vocal talent.
Cavalleria Rusticana, to a large extent, needs a brilliant orchestra and chorus. It got more than both last night and then some. So didPagliacci. Antony Walker has been noted on numerous occasions for being the splendid conductor he is, and last night he gave yet another example of what he and the orchestra can deliver. It was another display, in both operas, and, barring a few unfortunate slips, of the powerful and precise accompaniments these instrumentalists can be counted on to give. The chorus, directed byMark Trawka, and augmented by thePittsburgh Youth Chorus, gave brilliant accounts of themselves, especially in the swelling climaxes. The supernumeraries and actors, like the chorus, were brilliantly costumed and very impressive. One point on the costuming drew an amusing question, overheard. Why were Sicilian peasant w...

📰 ecidedly delicious" -- Entertainment Central Pittsburgh
🔗 https://entertainmentcentralpittsburgh.com/center-stage/tosca-review/
📄 Nội dung bài viết:
Pittsburgh Opera’s production of Tosca offers a stunning tableau of dramatic contrasts. As Sant’Andrea’s Te Deum devoutly begins, Baron Scarpia (on scaffold) unleashes his vile scheme.
One of the delights of opera is that most plots are simple. Classic opera tends toward pure melodrama. The hero rescues his love interest and vanquishes the villain. The formula is to be expected as tradition because it can be as comforting as macaroni and cheese or meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Either can be made more interesting with, perhaps, some crisp bacon, or a dash of hot sauce. But the basic recipe should offer no surprise unto itself. And, yet,TOSCA, Puccini’s classic opera about a diva who must rescue her lover, is a story baked in a very different oven. And it’s decidedly delicious. Pittsburgh Opera’sToscais onstage at Benedum Center through October 13.
Intriguing Entrees
Why? One reason is the entire storyline takes place in less than 24-hours. That dramatic conceit is not meant to drive the action. No bomb will explode if not diffused in less than seven minutes; no young princess is doomed to become an ugly hag at the stroke of midnight. Rather, the clock is employed to frame the tragedy of the story. The entire course of events takes place from one day to early dawn of the next as if to express to the audience “Can you believe this all could unfold so quickly?” It’s not so much a question as it is an exclamation. And that makes the story ofToscaall the more compelling. Sure, there are lively, lingering arias that dwell on love and yearning, and contrasting duets that confirm conflicts of character. But no one is rushing to the final act. Yet, once the audience gets there, well, it’s rather impressive to consider all that’s happened.
Diva Floria Tosca (Ana María Martínez) comforts her lover Cavaradossi (Jonathan Burton), confessing her resolve to his intended fate: death by firing squad.
A second reason is character. In storybook melodrama, the heroine is sweet and innoc...

ByGeorge B ParousonOctober 6, 2024•(0)
Outstanding Performance of Tried and True Standard by Giacomo Puccini Shows the Composer and Company at Their Best
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Pittsburgh Operaopened their new season last night at the Benedum, with a performance of Puccini’sToscathat surely astonished veteran operagoers and newbies alike, for a more impressive array of vocal talent, orchestral excellence and overall production satisfaction would be hard to imagine. It was the most outstanding presentation of the classic that these ears and eyes have heard and seen in a long list that spans the better part of a half century. And it was easily one of the best performances of any opera that the company has presented this century.
Baron Scarpia (Kyle Albertson) plants the seeds of suspicion in Floria Tosca (Ana María Martínez)
From the opening “vivacissimo con violenza” bars of the score, conductorAntony Walkerassured that the orchestra was in top form and at their best, and their playing through the three acts came as near perfection as it gets. Once or twice Walker was compelled to stop his instrumentalists because the audience broke protocol with applause, but this can be overlooked considering how long listeners sat through one thrill after another in silence. Because the vocal talent on stage was so powerful, Walker was able to give the orchestra free rein in the magnificent climaxes. The chorus, underMark Trawka, sang splendidly, as did thePittsburgh Youth Chorus, both groups making the first act a marvel of choral sound, as were the visual grouping and choreography as well.
Mario Cavaradossi (Jonathan Burton) aids escaped political prisoner Cesare Angelotti (Erik Nordstrom)
From the moment Resident ArtistErik Nordstrom, baritone, made his mad dash to center stage with the rise of the curtain, he proved that his debut with the company was a great success. In the time he had the stage...

The Pittsburgh Opera has been making opera for more than 80 years, and it’s one of the oldest companies in the country. The institution is so deeply entwined with Pittsburgh’s history that its headquarters is located in industrialist George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in the Strip District.
But how can an old institution practicing a European art form that’s been around for 400 years stay relevant in the age of TikTok?

ByGeorge B ParousonApril 29, 2024•(0)
Dramady with Operatic Interludes Opens at the Byham
By George B. Parous
The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson, as is widely known by now, is a play rather than an opera. There certainly is piano-accompanied singing, but about two thirds of the production is eloquently enunciated dialogue. It’s a masterfully crafted play that manages to encapsulate the persona of a remarkable woman into a tight 70 minutes. Much interest has been taken of late into remembering a neglected “local legend” and woman deserving her place in history, but the action is centered on one event that took place in Washington, D. C. Anyone expecting even a mention of Pittsburgh will be disappointed. But this is a good thing.
Sandra Seaton, in crafting her play, wisely chose to focus on one episode in a biographical subject’s life, rather than tackling an attempt to bring Mrs. Dawson’s “life and times” – and all who knew her – into an impossibly long story drawing heavily on psychological drama, a feat attempted by others with little success. She cleverly uses her text, as in Mrs. Dawson’s soliloquy, “I was so eager,” to encapsulate her fierce determination to see a future where others thrive on the fruits of her labors. Mrs. Dawson lived long enough to see the advent of singers such as Leontyne Price and others, though there were still obstacles to overcome. Even a partial list of well-known African American opera singers, present, and in the years following her death, would today make Mary Cardwell Dawson a passionately happy woman.
Mary Cardwell Dawson (Alyson Cambridge)
The basis synopsis of the play, without spoilers, has received publicity, and there were many on hand Saturday evening at the Byham to see and hear how it all played out. Thanks to solid material and much talent, it played very well. Careful attention to the dialogue is an absolute necessity, and one made ea...

ByGeorge B ParousonMarch 17, 2024•(1)
Singers, Orchestra, Chorus and Staging as Good as It Gets
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
It was a grand and large audience that heard and saw a spectacular performance of Giuseppe Verdi’sLa Traviatalast evening at the Benedum. The time-worn standard, so popular an opera for over a century and a half, had an especially hostile reception at its première. In the 1850s, it was not uncommon for European audiences to be demonstrative in the extreme. There was jeering because the soprano was large and close to forty, and the tenor fared no better than the orchestra. The day after the première, Verdi wrote to his friend Emanuele Muzio: “La traviatalast night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers’? Time will tell.” Verdi then tweaked the score a bit and it wasn’t long before the opera became the staple it is today.
There was a special sort of energy flowing on both sides of the footlights last evening. The audience was large and definitely in the mood for a night of “grand opera,” and that’s exactly what it got. The performance was “grand” in all departments, from the orchestra, to the singers, to the chorus and all of those behind the scenes, this production may be the best the company has offered this season. Photos can give an idea of the brilliance ofToddNonn’s lighting andPeter Dean Beck’s set designs;Glenn Avery Breed’s magnificent costumes and the choreography designed byAttack Theatre. Everyone included in the artistic team did a fine job and delivered a production better seen than described.

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
During the pandemic shutdown, performing-arts groups developed new online programming to try to reach audiences literally where they lived.
But once the shutdown ended, many patrons stayed home. So this week, Pittsburgh Opera is rolling out a new way to physically carry at least some audiences back to theaters — free door-to-door car service.
For the remainder of 2024, the opera will provide Uber vouchers worth $60 each to a limited number of ticket-buyers for each of its Downtown performances. Up to 75 vouchers will be available for each performance on a first-come, first-served basis.
The initiative — the first of its kind in Pittsburgh and perhaps for arts groups anywhere — was announced Monday. The first show to which it will apply is the opera’s new production of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” March 16-24 at the Benedum Center.
“The purpose of this program really is to eliminate barriers to people who want to be able to come to see Pittsburgh Opera performances but are concerned about transportation to get them to the theater,” said spokesperson Chris Cox.
As for many performing-arts groups, attendance at Pittsburgh Opera performances has rebounded from 2021, when large-scale in-person performances resumed, but not to pre-pandemic levels.
Cox said ticket revenue for the troupe’s biggest shows, staged at the Benedum Center, has averaged about 11% less since the fall of 2021 than they averaged in the several seasons before the pandemic.
Cox said both anecdotal feedback from audience members and Pittsburgh Cultural Trust surveys suggest one reason is patrons’ transportation worries.
“Sometimes they don’t feel like driving, they don’t want to worry about having to park somewhere or walking back to the parking lot after the show, and they might not live in an area where public transportation is convenient,” he said.
Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers, which can be used on the show’s performance date for rides starting or ending within a half-mile radiu...

Home›Our Posts›Review: Pittsburgh Opera Adds ‘Proving Up’ to its List of Season’s Successes
ByGeorge B ParousonFebruary 18, 2024•(0)
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Last eveningPittsburgh Operacontinued their season with the first night ofMissy Mazzoli’s chamber opera,Proving Up. With a libretto byRoyce Vavrek, adapted from a short story by Karen Russell, the 2018 opera has been called “brilliant” byMusical America,and “harrowing… powerful…a true opera of our time” by theWashington Post.  While set in the 1870s, the work is indeed, as theWashington Postsays, an opera of our time.
The music was everything I’ve come to expect from “modern day” opera composers. The “grand opera” idiom is avoided at all cost, as is melody and much in the way of sustained, lyrical passages for the singers. This work is not totally devoid of such things, but they are very much out of the picture.Proving Up, actually, might be the perfect “first opera” for people who think they don’t like opera. This one act production runs approximately 90 minutes, and be on time or you’re not being seated. Likewise, stay in your seat, because if you leave before the performance is over, you’re not getting back in.
As forRoyce Vavrek’s libretto, so much has been discussed in print and previews that much more would be a spoiler for people who like hearing and seeing new operas completely unawares. A link below will provide very detailed information regarding the plot, composer, performers, etc. As may be seen from the photos included, costumes, set designers, lighting, etc., were all entrusted to very capable hands. But angles from the arrangement of seats and other audience members, block much of the far ends of the stage for those seated in at least the third and fourth rows.

Resident Artist Tenor Speaks of Upcoming Production
Next Saturday, February 17, 2024, marks the first production byPittsburgh Operaof Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek’sProving Up, a work which has been called “Harrowing…powerful… a true opera of our time” byThe Washington Postand “A tense and creepy journey into the heart of Manifest Destiny’s darkness” byThe New York Times. TenorFran Daniel Laucerica, who will sing a leading role in the production, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and his career to date toChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera. We’re pleased that the company has shared the interview with us, exclusively, as below:
Chris Cox: Fran Daniel Laucerica, tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you end up at Pittsburgh Opera as a Resident Artist?
Fran Daniel Laucerica: I’m originally from Miami, Florida. I’ve always known and heard a lot of great things about Pittsburgh Opera. It was funny, I happened to be in town for some coachings with [Pittsburgh Opera Director of Musical Studies and Chorus Master]Mark Trawkaand [Pittsburgh Opera Music Director]Antony Walkerbecause I had a couple auditions coming up in Europe, when they learned that their tenor from last season, Daniel O’Hearn, wasn’t returning.
So, while I was in town, they both asked me, “Oh, do you have anything going on next season?”, and I said, “Well, nothing on the books yet apart from some individual gigs lined up.” And so eventually I got an email from [Pittsburgh Opera Director of Artistic Operations]Rob Boldinin the middle of the summer that said, “Hey, any interest?” And I said, “Definitely.” I immediately accepted it.
Chris Cox:What have some of the highlights been for you in your first half of the season so far?

Company Shares Exclusive Interview with Soprano Emily Richter, Who Will Appear in the Title Role
SopranoEmily Richter, who will sing the title role inPittsburgh Opera’sproduction ofIphigénie en Tauridebeginning this Saturday evening, January 20, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and her career to date toChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera. As Ms. Richter has done a great deal of genuinely excellent singing in her time with the company, much interest may be taken in her comments and observations.
Chris Cox: Emily Richter, please tell the audience a little bit about yourself.
Emily Richter: Thank you for having me. I’m a second year Resident Artist here at Pittsburgh Opera. I’m from Arlington, Virginia, but I’m a foreign service kid, so I grew up moving around a lot, mostly overseas.
Chris Cox: Where are some of the places you lived abroad growing up?
Emily Richter: Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Armenia, Geneva, DC, London. And while I was in college, my family was in Tokyo.
Chris Cox: Did you have a favorite place?
Emily Richter:   It’s always hard to say, because how do you compare being 8 years old to being 18? But when I was in London, it was a really formative time for me, not just in my life, but also musically. I was really involved with the National Youth Choir, and the London Youth Choir. I sang at the Royal Albert Hall, and with the Royal Philharmonic Chorus. I had really, really amazing musical experiences, and that was where I said to myself, “okay, I want to do this – I want to sing.”
Chris Cox:  Is that how you got into opera?
Emily Richter:   I grew up playing piano, doing choir, and just loving music, so I knew I wanted to do music as a career from a very young age. Once I got to college I became a Classical Voice major. That’s when I really committed to ...

The Briney Sea Tale of ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Appears to Be All That Pittsburgh Audiences Will Hear of Richard Wagner; the Gloom of the ‘Dutchman’ For the First Time in Two Decades
By George B. Parous
Last evening,Pittsburgh Operagave its first performance of aRichard Wagnermusic-drama in twenty years. The work was, of course,Der fliegende Holländer, and it was an excellent performance indeed. But why notTannhäuser? Lohengrin?Maybe one of the better known, stand alone “Ring” music-dramas, such asDie Walküre? Never heard locally in years and sure to pull in Wagnerian devotees from the tri-state area and/or beyond, any of these masterpieces, given with the right cast, conductor and director, notwithstanding financial and managerial trepidation, would thrill, and the novelty of any of Wagner’s works would test the Benedum’s seating capacity for all four performances. Or maybe cut the number of performances to three, making it easier for all, including the singers, orchestra and management. Instead, after large gaps in time, we’re thrownThe Flying Dutchman, a work which certainly has its beauties, but as a demonstration of Wagner’s genius is far – very far – from his best. But it’s comparatively short, for Wagner, and people can get to the garages before their carriages return to pumpkins, so it’s the “Dutchman” we get, or nothing.
The Dutchman (Kyle Albertson)
The mob on hand last night proved the point that Wagner can draw an audience. Whether the performances remaining in the run will do the same remains to be seen. The production is loaded with vocal talent and has a first-class orchestra and dynamic conductor to swell or sing softly from below, never drowning the singers, but remaining a vividly pronounced part of the performance, as Wagner intended. From the opening page of the music-drama’s inspired overture, it was plain...

The villagers, overshadowed by the Dutchman’s ship in port, assemble to celebrate a faithful marriage.
To understand one of the many merits Richard Wagner earned in his career as a composer of more than a dozen operas, a simplistic snapshot of the history of theater helps distinguish his early work.The Flying DutchmanorDer Fliegende Hollander, Pittsburgh Opera’s current offering at the Benedum Center, was last performed in Pittsburgh 20 years ago. At least, compared to other great operatic stories, there may have been a reason for the long wait. It’s not easy to recreate a masted ghost ship to dock on stage. But that reason has nothing to do with Wagner’s sweeping musical composition which elegantly, powerfully and dramatically places his audience on a precipice overlooking the raging Nordic Sea.
By 1800, albeit born from French Theater, the ideal dramatic plot had transformed from melodrama to the “well-made play.” The story of a melodrama unravels when a hero is cheated by a villain who in turn is defeated (or vanquished) with love (or valor) always stronger than treachery. It’s every plot that Jeanette McDonald and Nelson Eddy sang in their early “talkies” or that Dudley Do-Right, sweetheart Nell, and Snidely Whiplash clown around in more modern cartoons. The “well-made play” improved that formula. Still, there was a good guy and a bad guy, and at least one love interest, but added to the plot was a higher power––or a powerful secret––of which only the audience was made aware. Otherwise known as “dramatic irony,” the “well-made play” included this engaging pretense that the audience was smarter than either the hero or the villain. When a god would descend to end the conflict—or the missing letter was revealed to prove the truth––the story concluded with a major climax. Wagner’s idea for his tale about a lovesick captain doomed to sail the seven seas until he finds a faithful bride straddles these dramatic story structures. It’s pure melodrama but with a surprisin...

Tenor to Make His Local Debut Singing ‘Erik’ in Upcoming“The Flying Dutchman”Performances
TenorBryan Register, who will sing the role of Erik inPittsburgh Opera’s production ofDer fliegende Holländer, beginning this Saturday evening, November 11, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and his career – a career which began with the lateBirgit Nilssonfunding his education.ChrisCox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, provided the interview, as follows:
Chris Cox: “Thanks for joining me today, Bryan. I’ll start by asking, how did you first get interested in opera?”
Bryan Register: “The first time that I was exposed to opera was when I was in third grade. A troupe from Opera Carolina came to my elementary school. They did scenes from the opera that they were doing. And they did a mock opera with some of the students. We dressed in costumes that we brought from home. They did a fake stage, and staged a couple of scenes where they told us what the story was, and we were supposed to act out the scenes. The local newspaper was there taking pictures and put an article in the paper. I’ve got that picture of me from third grade doing the opera scene. That’s my operatic debut if you want to call it that.
“I can still remember how excited I was, and the feeling that I got when I heard the singers singing. It was so new, and there was something magical about it. And it was something that really attracted me. I didn’t know at that time that I really wanted to be an opera singer per se, because I was studying piano. But it was an aspect of music that I had not been exposed to before that I thought was fascinating.
“It reinforces how important outreach is, because you never know when you’re going to affect somebody’s life. That doesn’t mean that they have to end up being an opera singe...

Home›Our Posts›‘The Barber of Seville’ a Bright 85th Season Opener
ByGeorge B ParousonOctober 15, 2023•(0)
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Despite miserable weather and having a star baritone on the sick list,Pittsburgh Operaattracted a good-sized audience to a brilliant performance ofThe Barber of Seville(Il Barbiere di Siviglia)at the Benedum last evening. As is often the case, the tone of the evening was set byAntony Walkerand the orchestra “delivering” – and deliver they did, a superb rendition of Gioachino Rossini’s thrilling overture, some of the most inspired music in the classic, old, tuneful comedy. BaritoneJohn McCullough, the long-advertised singer who was to take the role of Figaro, the all-knowing barber of Seville, was unable to sing due to illness, but the company need not apologize for flying in – at the eleventh hour – the young, handsome and very giftedJohn Mooreto take his place. He has appeared in this production elsewhere, making for a test of his memory, and the little rehearsal time due to his last-minute arrival in Pittsburgh made his animated performance even more remarkable.
Moore has a rich, resonant voice and is an actor ideally suited to the part of Figaro. Despite a slightly clipped “Largo al factotum della città” (“Make way for the factotum of the city”), the role’s best-known aria, he gave a truly stellar rendition of the part, and with his voice and comedy gold, made a most auspicious debut with the company. The reception he received must surely have moved him deeply and made his unexpected trip worthwhile. Another baritone who gave a highly commendable performance, and, if memory serves, in his third appearance on the Pittsburgh Opera stage, was the versatileMusa Ngqungwana, who sings the role of Doctor Bartolo. His warmly burnished tones and naturally appealing stage presence make him a pleasure in any role he takes, be it tragedy or comedy. His extended range makes possible funny falsetto mockery in his Bartolo.

Late-nineteenth-century Italy saw the emergence of verismo, a new operatic genre that told the stories of the lives of the poor and disenfranchised. Works by Puccini, Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Giordano and Francesco Cilea in that style are among the most popular operas in the repertoire. Contemporary writers and composers are equally inspired by today’s stories, which are finding a toehold in the repertoire.
This month, Pittsburgh Opera staged two contemporary operas, Philip Venables’sDenis & Katyaand Daniel Bernard Roumain’sWe Shall Not Be Moved,that are direct heirs to the verismo tradition. Instead of consumptive seamstresses, homicidal clowns, hot-blooded Sicilian peasants and the like, Venables and Roumain rec...
