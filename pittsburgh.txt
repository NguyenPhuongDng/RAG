Pittsburgh(/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/PITS-burg) is a city inAllegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and itscounty seat. It is thesecond-most populous city in Pennsylvania(afterPhiladelphia) and the68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the2020 census. The city is located insouthwestern Pennsylvaniaat the confluence of theAllegheny RiverandMonongahela River, which combine to form theOhio River.It anchors thePittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both theOhio ValleyandAppalachia, thesecond-largest in Pennsylvania, and the26th-largest in the U.S.Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greaterPittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical areawhich includes parts ofOhioandWest Virginia.

Pittsburgh is known as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in thehistory of the U.S. steel industry.It developed as a vital link of theAtlantic coastandMidwest, as the mineral-richAllegheny Mountainsled to the region being contested by theFrenchandBritishempires,Virginians,Whiskey Rebels, andCivil War raiders.For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind onlyNew York CityandChicagoin corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.Deindustrializationin the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs amongblue-collar workersas steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.

Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical CenterandAllegheny Health Network, as well as68 colleges and universities, includingCarnegie Mellon Universityand theUniversity of Pittsburgh.The area has served as the federal agency headquarters forcyber defense,software engineering,robotics,energy research, and thenuclear navy.The city is home to tenFortune 500companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the "City of Bridges" for its446 bridges.Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including theCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium,Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, theNational Aviary, and a diversecultural district.The city's major leagueprofessional sports teamsinclude thePittsburgh Steelers,Pittsburgh Penguins, andPittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally whereJehovah's Witnessestraces its earliest origins, and was the host of the2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.

## Etymology

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish GeneralJohn Forbes, in honor of British statesmanWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was aScotsman, he probably pronounced the name/ˈpɪtsbərə/PITS-bər-ə(similar toEdinburgh).

Pittsburgh was incorporated as aboroughon April 22, 1794, with the following Act:"Be it enacted by thePennsylvania State SenateandPennsylvania House of Representativesof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."

From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the finalhwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop thehwas reversed.ThePittsburg Presscontinued spelling the city without anhuntil 1921.

## History

Kingdom of France1690s–1763Great Britain1681–1781United States1776–present

### Native Americans

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by theShawneeand several other settled groups ofNative Americans.Shannopin's Townwas an 18th-centuryLenape(Delaware) town located roughly from wherePenn Avenueis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerlyHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood.

### 18th century

The first known European to enter the region was the French explorerRobert de La SallefromQuebecduring his 1669 expedition down theOhio River.European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year Europeanfur tradersestablished area posts and settlements.

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to uniteCanadawithFrench Louisianavia the rivers.During 1753–1754, the British hastily builtFort Prince Georgebefore a larger French force drove them off. The French builtFort Duquesnebased on LaSalle's 1669 claims. TheFrench and Indian War, the North American front of theSeven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British GeneralEdward Braddockwas dispatched with MajorGeorge Washingtonas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.The British and colonial force were defeated atBraddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction onFort Pitt, named afterWilliam Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".

DuringPontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribeslaid siege to Fort Pittin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after ColonelHenry Bouquetdefeated a portion of the besieging force at theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.

During this period, the powerful nations of theIroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768Treaty of Fort Stanwix, thePennswere allowed to purchase the modern region from theIroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".Both theColony of Virginiaand theProvince of Pennsylvaniaclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend theMason–Dixon linewestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,Bedford County, Pennsylvaniawas created to govern the frontier.

On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created asPitt Township.William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.

Following theAmerican Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing theAppalachian Mountainsor through theGreat Lakes.Fort Pitt(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into theNorthwest Territory.

### 19th century

The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for theLewis and Clark Expedition.Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 whenMeriwether Lewispurchased akeelboatthat would later be used to ascend theMissouri River.

TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, manyWelsh peoplefrom theMerthyrsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of theMerthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany.

Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of theUnderground Railroadin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.

TheAmerican Civil Warboosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.Andrew Carnegiebegan steel production in 1875 at theEdgar Thomson Steel WorksinNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into theCarnegie Steel Company. He adopted theBessemer processto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

### 20th century

In 1901,J. P. Morganand attorneyElbert H. GarymergedCarnegie Steel Companyand several other companies intoU.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was thenation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

ThePittsburgh Agreementwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned byT. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation ofCzechoslovakia.

The city sufferedsevere floodingin March 1936.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-AmericanGreat Migrationfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.

DuringWorld War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"was being overshadowed byJames Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."

Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

### 21st century

During thelate 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, thePittsburghmetropolitan statistical area(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.

In September 2009, the2009 G20 Pittsburgh summitwas held in Pittsburgh.

## Geography

Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km), or 4.75%, is water. The80th meridian westpasses directly through the city's downtown.

The city is located on theAllegheny Plateau, within theecoregionof theWestern Allegheny Plateau.TheDowntownarea (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where theAllegheny Riverflows from the northeast and theMonongahela Riverfrom the southeast to form theOhio River. The convergence is atPoint State Parkand is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include theOaklandandShadysidesections, which are home to theUniversity of Pittsburgh,Carnegie Mellon University,Chatham University,Carnegie MuseumandLibrary, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.

ManyPittsburgh neighborhoodsare steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.

Thesteps of Pittsburghconsist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.

Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. TheGreat Allegheny PassageandChesapeake and Ohio CanalTowpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.

### Cityscape

The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,and four main areas surrounding it—Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.

Downtown Pittsburghhas 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with theU.S. Steel Towerbeing the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).TheCultural Districtspans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. TheFirstsideportion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctivePPG PlaceGothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by thePort Authority'slight rail systemandmultiple bridgesleading north and south.It is also home toPoint Park UniversityandDuquesne Universitywhich bordersUptown.

TheNorth Side, originally the independentAllegheny Cityuntil being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions likeAcrisure Stadium,PNC Park, theAndy Warhol Museum, and theNational Aviary, among others.

TheSouth Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.In the 1990s, theUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburghpurchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into theSouthSide Worksmixed-use development.

The East End includes key institutions including theUniversity of Pittsburgh,Carnegie Mellon University,Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, andPhipps Conservatory. It features many parks, includingMellon Park,Westinghouse Park,Schenley Park,Frick Park,The Frick Pittsburgh,Bakery Square, and thePittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods likeShadyside.Squirrel Hillis also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.Oakland is home to several universities and thePetersen Events Center. TheStrip Districtto the west along theAllegheny Riveris an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.Bloomfieldis Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers.Lawrencevilleis a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. TheHill Districtwas home to photographerCharles Harrisas well as various African-American jazz clubs.

TheWest EndincludesMt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such asSheradenandElliott.

### Regional identity

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of thePittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, acombined statistical areadefined by theU.S. Census Bureau.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders ofAppalachiaas defined by theAppalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

### Climate

Under theKöppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either ahot-summer humid continental climate(Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or ahumid subtropical climate(Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,a considerableheat indexarises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), onJanuary 19, 1994to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.

Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar toSeattle(49%).

United States Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.

Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.

As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city'surban forestbetween $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.

Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due tofrequently overflowing untreated sewagefrom the city's outdated infrastructure.Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.TheAllegheny County Sanitary Authority(ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.

ThePittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.

There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.

## Demographics

At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,compared to 78.7% in 1970.By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,and the fifth-largestUkrainiancommunity per the 1990 census.Pittsburgh has one of the most extensiveCroatiancommunities in the United States.Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country.

Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.

In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.

Themedian incomefor a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits areSquirrel HillandPoint Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year.

As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts areNorth Oakland(at 21,200 per square mile) andUptown Pittsburgh(at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits,DormontandMount Oliverare Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.

Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are fromChina,India,KoreaandItaly.

### Demographic changes

Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the LowerHill Districtunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of theCivic Arena, which opened in 1961.This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.

In the 1960s, theUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh(URA) aimed to revitalizeEast Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.

These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.

### Religion

According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be consideredProtestant, and 32% professingCatholicbeliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.

According to a 2010Association of Religion Data Archives(ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 "Catholics"; 326,125 "Mainline Protestants"; 174,119 "Evangelical Protestants;" 20,976 "Black Protestants;" and 16,405 "Orthodox Christians," with 996,826 listed as "unclaimed" and 16,405 as "other" in the metro area.A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies atBrandeis Universityestimated theJewish population of Greater Pittsburghwas 49,200.Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor toJehovah's Witnesseswas founded byCharles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from thePew Research Center.

## Economy

Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology,robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism,biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.ANational Bureau of Economic Research2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobilityor theAmerican Dream.Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998Nabiscofactory, a complex known asBakery Square.Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.Pittsburgh's transition from itsindustrial heritagehas earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh'smodelin order to renew their industries and economic base.

The largest employer in the city is theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: "That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s."

Education is a major economic driver in the region. The largest single employer in education is theUniversity of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees.

The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhatstaccatorhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have promptedThe New York Timesto describe Pittsburgh as "theGalapagos Islandsof American dialect".The lexicon itself contains notable loans fromPolishand other European languages; examples includebabushka,pierogi, andhalušky.

More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):

At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.

In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.

Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories "police budget cost per person," "fines / forefeitures," "Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population)," "Force Used per Arrest," "Racial Disparities in Deadly Force," "Excessive Force Complaints Upheld," "Discrimination Complaints Upheld," "Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld," "Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses," and "Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests."

### Health discoveries

While he was a professor at theUniversity of Pittsburgh, American virologistJonas Salkdeveloped one of the first successfulpolio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.

UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-oldStormie Jonesin 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).

The Lancetpublished a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.
