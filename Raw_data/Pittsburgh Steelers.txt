## Frequently Asked Questions
## Game in Ireland

[CONTENT] : The NFL has earmarked Dublin as a new international game market for 2025 and strategically selected the Steelers to play in the game as the designated team.
[CONTENT] : As part of the Global Markets Program the Steelers have been awarded marketing rights on the island of Ireland because of Steelers' ownership family's deep roots there.
[CONTENT] : Global growth is a major strategic priority for the league and 32 teams.

## About the Steelers, Ireland & the NFL's 'Global Markets Program'
[CONTENT] : The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US.
[CONTENT] : NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market.
[CONTENT] : There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature.
[CONTENT] : When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward.
[CONTENT] : The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences.
[CONTENT] : The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced.

[CONTENT] : A seat license allows the account holder to resell or transfer seat license ownership of seats once he or she no longer wishes to purchase season tickets. For unlicensed seats, season tickets can remain in the account holder's name only. Once the account holder of unlicensed seats no longer wishes to or is no longer able to renew the seats, those seats are returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Unlicensed seat locations include sections 519-526, section 219, section 226, and sections 101 rows A-EE and 144 rows A-JJ.
[CONTENT] : If we have licensed seats available through our office, the seat license fees will be applied to those seat locations. The seat license is a required, one-time, nonrefundable fee, so once it is paid, you are only responsible for purchasing the season ticket package each year.
[CONTENT] : No, your unlicensed seats will remain in your name for each season as long as you choose to purchase them. Unlicensed seats do not have an associated seat license, so they also do not have a licensed seat owner. Therefore, your unlicensed seats are renewable to you each year.
[CONTENT] : No, all unlicensed seat locations are and will remain permanently unlicensed.
[CONTENT] : The Pittsburgh Steelers have a relocation request process for Season Ticket Holders who wish to relocate within Acrisure Stadium. Each Season Ticket Holder becomes eligible to request a relocation after completing one full season with the team. Requests should be submitted to the Steelers by email and can be made for unlicensed or licensed seat locations.
[CONTENT] : Yes, you are still able to post tickets for sale and transfer individual game tickets through your Account Manager, even if your seats are unlicensed.
[CONTENT] : Yes, as a season ticket holder, you would have first right of refusal to your seat location for potential postseason games. Each new Season Ticket Holder will receive postseason registration information in mid-August. Postseason games are not a required purchase, but we would love to have you join us at Acrisure Stadium for playoffs!
[CONTENT] : You will be able to receive two offers while on the Wait List. We cannot guarantee the offers will take place over two consecutive years, but we typically are able to send your second offer within back to back seasons. You would still hold your same position in line, so you do not have to worry about dropping to the bottom of the list. However, if you do decline your second offer, then you will have to re-sign up for the Wait List.
[CONTENT] : No, once you are a season ticket holder, you will be removed from the Wait List and are no longer eligible to purchase tickets through a Wait List offer. This includes season ticket holders who sign up through theSTR Marketplace.
[CONTENT] : We send offers to members of the Wait List by sign-up date. Wait List members are not assigned a number in line. You will receive an offer in accordance with the date you officially became a member of the Wait List. Always keep your contact information up to date on your Wait List account to ensure that you will receive your emailed offer.
[CONTENT] : To update your address, please email us atSTH@Steelers.comwith your current information.
## Too excited to wait? You can purchase a stadium seat license from a current season ticket holder on the Seat License Marketplace.

[CONTENT] : Contributing Writer/Editor
[CONTENT] : Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin not only understands the frustration of fans over the team's early exit from the 2024 postseason, he shares the sentiment.
[CONTENT] : The Steelers were defeated, 28-14, last Saturday in the Wild Card playoffs by the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium, ending their season. And the process of sifting through what went right, and, perhaps more importantly, what went wrong, has now begun.
[CONTENT] : "There's football justice. You get what you deserve," Tomlin said Tuesday at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex in his final press conference for the 2024 season. "We're here and we're here for really tangible reasons.
[CONTENT] : "We didn't evolve in the right ways. We didn't strike the right chords at the right time particularly down the stretch so we've been eliminated from the single-elimination tournament. For us, it's about assessing the reasons why, doing an assessment of every component of what it is we do here in the manner in which we do it, but we're at the very infancy of that. It comes to a screeching halt in this business and those of us that have been in it for a long time kind of understand that, but we also understand that moving forward happens pretty quickly."
[CONTENT] : Assessing the situation and making the necessary changes is part of the process.
[CONTENT] : The Steelers began the season 10-3, but saw things fall apart down the stretch, starting with a three-game stretch in 11 days in which they played Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City, all three of which are among the final eight teams standing in the NFL postseason.
[CONTENT] : Though they have earned a spot in the playoffs in three of the past four seasons, they've been beaten by Kansas City (2021), Buffalo (2023) and Baltimore in the opening round of each of those seasons.
[CONTENT] : Tomlin thought this season's team was better positioned to compete with the NFL's top teams, and the Steelers did go 4-3 against playoff teams and 2-3 against teams still alive in the postseason with wins over the Ravens and Commanders.
[CONTENT] : But they didn't win in the postseason, and that's all that matters to Tomlin, who expressed disappointment in that fact.
[CONTENT] : "A component of that disappointment is I thought this collective was better positioned, maybe more so than in recent years to not be in this similar place, but we are," Tomlin said. "There's obviously a lot of work to do to be quite honest with you. I'm energized in terms of beginning the process of doing it because I'm a competitor. I love this game and this business, even when it's miserable. I've seen so much in it and been through so much in it, very rarely do I respond to the present circumstance, whether it's positive or negative, because of the depths of the relationship that I have with the game.
[CONTENT] : "I expressed that to the team yesterday, because it's not only my job to obviously lead the group and strategize and so forth, but also to provide perspective. We got a lot of young guys who played major roles, who evolved in a lot of ways. I'm excited about them continuing their individual journeys and enhancing those and getting better and better positioning themselves to be significant as we move forward."
[CONTENT] : That will entail plenty of meetings and internal examination in the days, weeks and months ahead as the Steelers map out a strategy for 2025 that will end with the desired results.
[CONTENT] : That process has already begun.
[CONTENT] : "Certainly there's change that comes when we don't have the desired outcome and those are just the realities of the business," Tomlin acknowledged. "I would imagine there's going to be some things that change around here on a lot of levels but that's just this game, as I mentioned.
[CONTENT] : "I met with (team president) Art Rooney yesterday. I met with (general manager) Omar (Khan) yesterday, and those are just the very beginning of multiple conversations in terms of how we wrap a bow around some of the lessons learned, analyze some of the decisions made, personnel, strategy, etc., and those type of discussions are going on on a lot of levels. How can we keep our team healthier? That was a discussion that happened yesterday, for example. We experienced a rash of soft tissue injuries that was impactful, and that's just an example of many of the things and subjects that we have covered and will continue to cover as we assess what transpired and quickly transition ourselves and build for the future at the same time."
[CONTENT] : √¢¬Ä¬¢Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here:Apple Podcast|iHeart PodcastPittonline@iheartmedia.com
[CONTENT] : That will include some in-depth discussions regarding the team's plans at quarterback.
[CONTENT] : Russell Wilson, Justin Fields and Kyle Allen, all brought in for the 2024 season, all have expiring contracts.
[CONTENT] : Tomlin said he and Khan will meet for the first time later this week to begin discussions regarding the direction the team chooses to take in regard to the quarterback position for 2025.
[CONTENT] : "We don't have a quarterback under contract and so we've got some major discussions there," Tomlin said. "It was a really good experience with the three quarterbacks that were on our roster this year, individually and collectively. We are certainly open to considering those guys, but there's a lot of work ahead of us. The major work starts first and foremost just understanding what our options are ... what the field looks like in terms of free agency, what the draft pool looks like and then beginning the process in terms of decision-making based on known variables."
[CONTENT] : They aren't necessarily comfortable conversations or decisions to make. But they are necessary ones when it applies to falling short of the team goals and attempting to change that outcome.
[CONTENT] : "Certainly there's going to be pain in terms of watching the rest of the tournament from the outside, but there's a lot of misfortune in this business," Tomlin said. "Ultimately, you get what you got coming to you. Certainly as uncomfortable as it is, there had better be growth in it for us individually and collectively and the effort to make sure 2025 doesn't end in a similar way."
