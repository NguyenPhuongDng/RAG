## Wineries & Distilleries
[CONTENT] : In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time. This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol.Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery. Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County. Follow this handy map on where to find Pittsburgh spirits, pre-mixed cocktails, wine, cider, mead and more!

In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets,click here.

## Privacy
[CONTENT] : VisitPittsburgh is concerned about your privacy.
[CONTENT] : We want you to understand what Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you, and how we use your Personally Identifiable Information.
## What is "Personally Identifiable Information"?
[CONTENT] : "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. This includes information that is used in a way that is personally identifiable, including linking it with identifiable information from other sources, or from which other personally identifiable information can easily be derived, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information. To the extent unique information (which by itself is not Personally Identifiable Information) such as a personal profile, unique identifier, biometric information, and IP address is associated with Personally Identifiable Information, then such unique information is also considered Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.
## What PII does VisitPittsburgh collect and how?
[CONTENT] : When you register on our VisitPittsburgh Web Site, we will ask you for certain PII such as, your address, telephone number, and e-mail address. If you use our Request for Proposal option, we will ask you for detailed information regarding your meeting requirements so that responding proposals from our members are on-target with your needs. If you send VisitPittsburgh correspondence, via email, fax, or regular mail, or if other users or third parties such as businesses send us correspondence about your activities in connection with your use of the Web Site, VisitPittsburgh may retain that information. Further, if any third parties provide information to us about you, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Certain features of Web Site might only be available through the use of such tools. For example, cookies help to reduce the number of times you need to enter certain information about yourself or a planned event while on the site. Cookies can also help us provide information about services that are targeted to your particular interests. Cookies are stored on your local machine, not on the site. You are always free to decline cookies if your browser has this functionality, although if you do so, you might not be able to use certain features on the VisitPittsburgh Web Site which are dependent on the information those cookies collect, and you might be required to reenter certain information more frequently during a session. VisitPittsburgh will not link information collected by cookies to any PII.
[CONTENT] : Additionally, VisitPITTSBURGH collects demographic data from Google's interest-based advertising through Google Analytics. As a user you can opt-out of the Google Analytics bydownloading and installing the opt-out add-on for your browser.
## How does VisitPittsburgh use PII?
[CONTENT] : We use the information you provide through the registration process: to provide you with the information and services you request; to communicate with you on matters relating to the Web Site and your account; to provide necessary information to our member hotels, convention centers, meeting places, and other businesses to permit them to prepare proposals for you in response to your Requests for Proposals and/or provide other requested information; and to provide you with information about related services and/or products from our members.
[CONTENT] : Information that is automatically collected regarding your activities while visiting our Web Site is used to enhance your interactive experience during your visit. Use of this information helps us to better understand and immediately respond to your particular interests while you navigate our site. This information as well as demographic information derived from your registration and others may be aggregated and shared with associates and third parties, but only in aggregated form that does not contain any PII.
[CONTENT] : In addition, VisitPittsburgh uses information maintained about you, and other information obtained from your current and past activities to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and, if necessary, to enforce our rights. At times, VisitPittsburgh may review the information of multiple users to identify problems or to resolve disputes.
## What choices are available regarding the collection, use and disclosure of PII?
[CONTENT] : You may at any time choose to disclose or not disclose the PII we request; however, if you choose not to disclose the requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the information or services you request.
[CONTENT] : If you do not wish to receive certain communications from VisitPittsburgh such as marketing communications, you may opt out by declining the service offered or informing us that you no longer wish to receive such communications. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request unless such communications are necessary for the administration of your account, required by law, or necessary to protect our rights.

## The Tourism Economy
[CONTENT] : Tourism is a major economic driver. Tourism helps Allegheny County residents and businesses.
[CONTENT] : A message from Jerad Bachar, President and CEO
[CONTENT] : Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, one statement has stood true - the only certainty is uncertainty. Uncertainty causes high levels of stress and insecurity for us all. One section of our community that is struggling the most is our business owners and workforce within the travel and hospitality industry. I don‚Äôt believe that any other industry has been affected more by policy restrictions, economic distress and loss of employment.
## The Impact in Allegheny County
[CONTENT] : According to research conducted by Tourism Economics, Allegheny County‚Äôs tourism industry will have lost $3.6 billion in visitor spending and 24,540 jobs by the end of 2020. As residents, we see this impact every day as we witness the closure or reduced business levels of hotels, restaurants, museums, airlines, transportation companies, event organizers (conventions, sports and festivals), independent retailers and many others. While we understand and support the measures that have been taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we also mourn the temporary loss of an entire industry.
[CONTENT] : As we have seen in the past, the travel industry is resilient and can be rebuilt, allowing our neighborhood businesses to recover. Elected officials, healthcare officials and travel industry leaders have all predicted that our economic and societal recovery will take many months if not many years. The ‚Äònew normal‚Äô is upon us.
## A Formula for Success
[CONTENT] : If this is to be the best environment in which we live, we must find ways to not only survive but to thrive. If daily COVID-19 case counts and mitigating health risks is our reality for the foreseeable future, we should strive to find a better formula for success for hundreds of businesses and thousands of workers who are trying to get by.
[CONTENT] : We can collectively thrive if:
[CONTENT] : We recognize these efforts are underway, and we have yet to reach a balance. If we are to survive - and hopefully thrive - as we move forward, we must continue to work together to find the right formula. Together, we can bring Pittsburgh back.
## Impact of Tourism in Allegheny County
[CONTENT] : Travel and tourism is one of the largest industries in Allegheny County.
[CONTENT] : Consider this:
## The Breakdown
[CONTENT] : There are more than12.6 millionovernight trips to the Greater Pittsburgh region every year. In Allegheny County, visitor spending contributes to$6.57 billionin new dollars to the economy. How does that translate?

## VisitPITTSBURGH's Response to Allegheny County Controller‚Äôs Audit
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄãVisitPITTSBURGH refutes Allegheny County Controller's audit, as it includes factual errors, inaccuracies and omits key performance data. VisitPITTSBURGH asserts that although the audit found no irregular or unethical business practices, the report includes claims and assumptions based on opinion, not facts or data.

## VisitPITTSBURGH Announces Response to Politically Motivated Allegheny County Audit; Report Includes Factual Errors, Inaccuracies and Omits Key Performance Data
[CONTENT] : PITTSBURGH‚Äì VisitPITTSBURGH today announced its official response to the performance audit published by the Allegheny County Controller‚Äôs Office and called out the content of audit ‚Äúfindings‚Äù that include factual errors, misleading information and the selective omission of relevant information, including performance results, that are critical to understanding the reported data. This audit was requested by Sen. Wayne Fontana, who is also board chair of the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County.
[CONTENT] : VisitPITTSBURGH asserts that the audit found no irregular or unethical business practices, and the report includes claims and assumptions based on opinion, not facts or data.
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúVisitPITTSBURGH is responsible for driving business, sports and leisure tourism into the county, and we have a proven, documented track record of transparency and success,‚Äù said VisitPITTSBURGH President & CEO Jerad Bachar. ‚ÄúThis audit contains factual errors, misinformation and language that is misleading, most notably regarding VisitPITTSBURGH‚Äôs accounting processes, which have been in place for more than 20 years and audited ‚Äì and validated ‚Äì by multiple external CPA firms, as well as the County.
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúWe manage our finances in full compliance with all GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) guidelines,‚Äù added Bachar. ‚ÄúTo be clear, these processes accurately, appropriately and thoroughly record all hotel tax income and associated spending according to GAAP and FASB guidelines. Any language in this audit that states or implies otherwise is untrue.‚Äù
[CONTENT] : VisitPITTSBURGH also called attention to the fact that the audit selectively omits data on VisitPITTSBURGH‚Äôs sales and marketing results.
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúWhile this audit was announced publicly as a performance audit, it fails to report VisitPITTSBURGH‚Äôs performance results, which include the 223 business and sports events confirmed by the organization in 2022 that have an estimated $266 million economic impact value for local businesses,‚Äù said Bachar. ‚ÄúDetailed data on the tracked results of our sales and marketing efforts were shared publicly and with the auditors, including total number of events and room nights booked by VisitPITTSBURGH sales staff; this follows national industry standards used to gauge the effectiveness of a Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) and is a critical measure of our performance. The deliberate omission of performance results in a performance audit is not only baffling and suspect, it also presents an incomplete and biased assessment to the public, who have the right to an impartial, comprehensive and factual report.‚Äù
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúFailure to report VisitPITTSBURGH‚Äôs sales effort results is also a disservice to the dedicated team of employees who have brought hard-won business to Pittsburgh, beating out competitor cities in the aftermath of a global pandemic, and in the last year alone, securing strong business and sports events and hotel room night bookings,‚Äù said VisitPITTSBURGH Board of Directors Chairperson Michele Meloy Burchfield.
[CONTENT] : VisitPITTSBURGH notes that it cooperated fully during the audit process, made multiple offers to clarify and walk auditors through its accounting processes and is fully transparent in reporting details of both its fiscal and performance results, as well as its budget and spending. Performance results are continually measured and shared regularly with stakeholders. Audited financial statements and detailed performance results are shared viaAnnual Reports;Quarterly Performance Overviews, which deliver data-supported performance statistics for sales and marketing activities every three months; bi-weekly newsletters; and at Annual Meetings that provide details of performance in all areas of marketing and sales, including business, sports and leisure, communications, and services.
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúWe look forward to working with the Controller‚Äôs Office and our community of stakeholders to ensure a prosperous and successful Pittsburgh,‚Äù Bachar said. ‚ÄúVisitPITTSBURGH remains committed to its mission of generating economic impact through business, sports and leisure tourism, and showcasing Pittsburgh as a vibrant, global destination that is welcoming to all. We continue our dedication to working with all stakeholders, including the Sports & Exhibition Authority, to move the industry forward.‚Äù

## 1900 - 1949
[CONTENT] : Learn about the events in the early 1900s that led to the formation of the VisitPittsburgh Convention and Tourist Bureau.
[CONTENT] : While the Convention and Tourist Bureau officially opened its doors in 1935 at 411 Seventh Avenue, the ninth floor of the Chamber of Commerce Building, Suite 905, several events had happened before then that played a role in Pittsburgh Tourism and Convention business.
## 1909
[CONTENT] : Forbes Field was built in Oakland.
## 1916
[CONTENT] : TheWilliam Penn Hotelwas built in downtown Pittsburgh.
## 1924
[CONTENT] : A handy folder was issued by the Chamber of Commerce and bearing the title, "Pittsburgh, a Mecca for Auto Tourists" saying, "The impression has gotten about among motorists that Pittsburgh is a good city to avoid en tour. It is true that traffic conditions are somewhat congested and difficult in downtown Golden Triangle, due to the peculiar topography of the City. But to drive through, guided by efficient traffic officers, gives the tourist a conception not to be otherwise gained of the greatness of Pittsburgh as a manufacturing metropolis." After the creation of the Convention and Tourist Bureau, "Pittsburgh: The Convenient Convention City" project began.
## 1936
[CONTENT] : On February 13, 1936, a letter was sent out to attend "the greatest gathering of important business, civic, and educational leaders ever staged in Pittsburgh." The event was "a sensational dinner show to be held at the William Penn on February 17th." This was the first event of the "Sell Pittsburgh to America" campaign, and probably the first event of the Pittsburgh Convention and Tourist Bureau. The program itself was called "Let''s Go Pittsburgh." The original board consisted of 84 members, 7 of which served on an executive committee.
[CONTENT] : The Organized Effort Pamphlet:
## 1939
[CONTENT] : The first Tourist''s Information Center opened. The center was manned by police patrolman Ira Bing, who answered 400 questions, mostly from out of town visitors, at the new center on the Forbes Street Plaza entrance to Schenley Park.
## 1945
[CONTENT] : In 1945 the Pittsburgh Convention and Tourist Bureau changed its name to Pittsburgh Convention Bureau, Inc. At this time, the Bureau''s chief executive was Adolph "Tony" Frey. Charles Shaffer was Manager of the Bureau.
## 1946
[CONTENT] : A brochure titled "Pa Pitt Welcomes You: Here''s Your Key to the City of Pittsburgh" was published in 1946. It appeared to be a very early, if not the first, Official Visitors Guide to Pittsburgh. A caricature of Pa Pitt could have been the official mascot of Pittsburgh. Although pictured on the brochure, he is not identified as such. Topics included in the brochure were: Maps of downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland Civic Center showing hotels; principal buildings and points of interest; Welcomes from Mayor David L. Lawrence and the Pittsburgh Convention Bureau, Inc; "Pittsburgh Home of..." (a two page list of some of the things only Pittsburgh is home to); 3 pages of Points of Interest; 2 pages of General Facts about Pittsburgh; and Allegheny County Ways to reach nearby boroughs and outlaying districts ‚Äîvisitors would find the name of the borough then select the desired route number for the proper bus or trolley.

## Other Important Pittsburgh Events
[CONTENT] : The late 1930s and the 1940s were a time of growth for the newly founded Allegheny County Tourist Promotion Agency. There were several other things happening throughout the region at that time.

## 1950s
[CONTENT] : In the 1950s, the Pittsburgh Convention Bureau, Inc. changed its name to Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureau, Inc.
[CONTENT] : The late 1950s also saw the creation of the first Bureau logo‚Äîan illustration of the City as seen from the Point.
[CONTENT] : "This is the New Pittsburgh" was an economic development brochure published in 1958. It provided the history of the Bureau since the Great Flood of ''36 ("It started with Flood, Smoke Control"). Inside was a map with points of interest, major office buildings, churches, hotels, theaters, terminals, department stores and parking garages. This document also had things to see and do: "Pittsburgh Welcomes You," "Early History," and "Workshop of the World." There was also a section of facts about Pittsburgh.
## "This is the New Pittsburgh" brochure:
[CONTENT] : With so much happening for the Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureau, it''s amazing that the organization only had four staff members: Charles Shafer (Executive Vice President), John Johnson (Sales), Jane Walsh (Office Manager) and a Secretary.

## 1960s
[CONTENT] : The Convention Bureau, under the leadership of Charles Shaffer, spun off from the Chamber of Commerce in 1963 after 28 years and, as part of that arrangement, Mr. Shaffer soon retired. John Besanceny then joined the Bureau as its Executive Director.
[CONTENT] : Also in the 1960s, the Tourism Promotion Agency (TPA) Matching Funds program was launched by the state legislature to provide 50/50 matching grants to tourist promotion agencies throughout the state. This program is still in place today. In 1969, this program gave $24,602 to the PCVB to lure conventions and tourists to the city. Today this grant comes in at almost a million dollars‚Äîhow things have changed in less than 40 years!
[CONTENT] : Staff at the Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureau were involved in the ongoing discussion and eventually the establishment of Sunday liquor sales in the hotels in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, a major coup at the time.
[CONTENT] : On April 1, 1968, Robert Imperata joined the staff of the Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureau. Mr. Imperata retired on September 1, 2007 after almost 40 years of service to Pittsburgh''s tourism and convention industry. He will be missed.
## Robert P. Imperata, then and now:
[CONTENT] : From 1950-1969 the growth of Pittsburgh''s Tourism Promotion Agency was widespread‚Äîfrom staff changes to state grants, much progress was made in this tourism industry, leading to it being named the second biggest industry in the state of Pennsylvania, following only Agriculture, an honor the industry still holds today.

## City With A Smile Brochure:

[CONTENT] : In 1999, the Bureau launched a Local Awareness Campaign, designed to raise visibility of the travel and tourism industry and its economic impact on the community.

[CONTENT] : The 20th century went out with a bang at the Greater Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureau. With an annual budget of $8.4 million, 411,717 visitor inquires processed, 614 conventions booked and dozens of awards received Y2K didn't seem so scary to the GPCVB.

## 13 New Year‚Äôs Traditions and Superstitions
[CONTENT] : An empty suitcase could mean travel in 2024!
[CONTENT] : Before I get started, let me introduce myself. I am Barb, 65-years-young, African-American who was born, raised and educated in Pittsburgh. I currently work for VisitPITTSBURGH as the Destination and Visitors Services Manager. I grew up in a family that believed in and practiced many superstitions ‚Äì everyday as well as New Year‚Äôs superstitions. While I do not walk under ladders, I do bless a sneeze, and 13 is sort of my lucky number.
## Rounded up below are 13 of the most popular New Year's traditions and superstitions for your consideration:
[CONTENT] : Thought:Grocery shopping New Year's Eve is the new date night. Make a run to the Strip District for all your New Year's needs: cheese fromPennsylvania Macaroni Company; halal foods fromSalem's; Asian staples from Lotus; all your fish fromWholey‚Äôs; all your Greek food staples fromStamoolis Brothers Co.and so much more!Why stop there? Make a donation to theGreater Pittsburgh Community Food Bankand make sure your neighbors also have full cabinets for the new year.
[CONTENT] : A post shared by Pennsylvania Macaroni Company (@pennmacco)
[CONTENT] : Thought:Does that include all the gift cards and certificates I've accumulated in my personal mission to support all mylocal favorite businesses? They are cash equivalent, right?
[CONTENT] : A post shared by Daily Bread (@dailybread)
[CONTENT] : Thought:No problem ‚Äì never have to tell me twice on this one! I have plans to pick up my favorite knitting magazines, maybe a new romance novel (procured from acute local bookstore) and on New Year‚Äôs Day I‚Äôll be listening to my smooth jazzalbumswhile contemplating my next knit project (with hand-dyed yarn fromSongbird Artistry).
[CONTENT] : A post shared by White Whale Books & Coffee (@whitewhalebks)
[CONTENT] : Thought:A little fresh air never hurts; it could even help rid your house of the smell of dinner you burned the night before. Where do all of those spirits end up? That'sHaunted Pittsburgh Ghost Tour's business.
[CONTENT] : Eat Collard Greens and Black-Eyed Peas- Collards represent cash, and black-eyed peas represent coin to bring wealth in the new year.Thought:Stock up on these! Goveganat least once a week to keep the cash flow coming!
[CONTENT] : Thought:Easy‚Ä¶I will call my son to say, "Come visit your mother and bring my granddaughter with you!" As for my gift, it better be somethinglocal from my list.
[CONTENT] : Thought:Stick with the pig because he always moves forward ‚Äì plus, I have a delicious pork chop recipe! And another run to the Strip District to get pork fromStrip District Meats. They have a huge variety of beef, pork and lamb, as well as smoked meats. Visit their website and pick a recommended recipe to try, then go visit in person. For the more adventurous, Strip District Meats also offers a wide variety of exotic meats including elk, emu and venison!
[CONTENT] : A post shared by Pittsburgh's Leading Meatailer (@stripdistrictmeats)
[CONTENT] : Thought:Don‚Äôt have noisemakers‚Ä¶stack up some pots and pans then accidentally knock them over. That would scare the bejesus out of anybody! Plus, Downtown Pittsburgh will have enough fireworks going off duringFirst Nightto scare out any spirits in a 100-mile radius.
[CONTENT] : Thought:Then go online and start checking travel deals! May I suggest you visit Pittsburgh in the near future? We're here to help youplan!
[CONTENT] : Thought:Keep it small‚Ä¶otherwise the first person to cross your threshold might be a tall, dark, handsome fireman! Bonus points if you use cute stationery fromLove, PittsburghandKards Unlimited.
[CONTENT] : A post shared by love, Pittsburgh (@lovepittsburghshop)
[CONTENT] : Thought:Be honest: do you really want to keep an old calendar? Better yet, support a local photographer likeDustin McGrewand buy a Pittsburgh-centric calendars for the new year!
[CONTENT] : A post shared by Dustin McGrew (@dustinmcgrew)
[CONTENT] : In case you are wondering, I‚Äôm trying my hardest not to repeat last year! I plan to eat/drink grapes on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and I will be making pork chops, black-eyed peas and collards on New Year‚Äôs Day. And, I will NOT be doing anything that remotely resembles work.Happy New Year!

When asked what he‚Äôs been up to since last year's Pride festivities, Staples admits it‚Äôs been a whirlwind, in the best way. ‚ÄúAfter wrapping up last year‚Äôs All Out (Formerly Pride on the Shore),‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI dove headfirst into planning ‚Äî not just for this year‚Äôs Pride, but also expanding All Out Music Fest to new cities, including Columbus.‚Äù He shares that it‚Äôs been nonstop behind-the-scenes ‚Äî booking artists, refining experiences and making sure this year‚Äôs events are even bigger and better.
## So what can Pittsburgh folks expect from this year's extravaganza?
[CONTENT] : ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre keeping the heart of All Out Pride the same,‚Äù Staples promises. ‚ÄúIt's still a space where everyone is welcome, celebrated and can dance their hearts out.‚Äù
[CONTENT] : And when it comes to new additions, they‚Äôve expanded the production and energy. ‚ÄúThis year is all about leveling up: bigger stage, brighter lights and more immersive moments between sets,‚Äù Staples explains. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also bringing in some surprise elements (think confetti, CO2 blasts) to make those headliner moments unforgettable. Plus, we‚Äôre putting a bigger spotlight on local talent and drag royalty, making sure our lineup reflects the full spectrum of this amazing community.‚Äù
[CONTENT] : Staples, for one, feels great excitement about the 2025 lineup. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kicking Pride weekend off with high-energy dance and club vibes ‚Äî Galantis, Hayla, Dragonette and a Miami drag takeover and so much more,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think it gives folks a chance to experience both sides of Pride ‚Äî the wild celebration and the feel-good unity.‚ÄùGalantis is obviously going to bring the heat, Staples reassures, since they never miss when it comes to delivering those euphoric drops. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm also really hyped for Hayla,‚Äù he shares. ‚ÄúHer voice paired with those dance beats is going to give people chills.‚Äù He believes this lineup will be iconic, and that there‚Äôs truly something for everyone.
[CONTENT] : When it comes to preparing to attend, Staples advises folks to: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! ‚ÄúAnd wear whatever makes you feel your absolute best,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúthis is your space to shine.‚Äù For first-timers, Staples suggests getting there early to soak in the vibe, check out local performers and stake out a good spot. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt be shy; Pittsburgh‚Äôs Pride crowd is one of the friendliest you‚Äôll meet,‚Äù he says.Plan your ride home ahead of time, too, so you can end the night stress-free. And most importantly, Staples says, ‚ÄúTalk to strangers, dance like nobody‚Äôs watching, and let yourself be fully in the moment.‚Äù
