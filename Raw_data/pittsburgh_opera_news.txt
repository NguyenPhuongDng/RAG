ByGeorge B ParousonApril 28, 2025•(0)
Season Closes with 1stPerformances of Jennifer Higdon & Jerre Dye’s Take on a Real-life Art Heist, with three Alternate Endings
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Saturday evening, the crowd that filledPittsburgh Opera’s Bitz Studioin the Strip heard the world première ofWoman With Eyes Closed, as the company gave the enigmatic “family portrait” a rousing  first performance that gave new meaning to the title. Tuesday night’s audience will hear the opera with a different conclusion and other nights a third. Advance sales created the need for an additional performance, the unusual Saturday, May 3, 2025, 2:00 PM matinee. What this and the other audiences hear will be the preview audience’s choice and even a chance at the cast’s selection.
Higdon and Dye’s work provided a fine night of genuine entertainment, and will do so until the lights dim at Pittsburgh Opera until the autumn. Briefly, when Mona – a tormented woman with true maternal instincts, finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen artworks, she must struggle with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son – the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence against her son, but one of the paintings -Lucian Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”- looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was young. “The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.” Women with eyes closed take on a new meaning.
Each time the Bitz Studio is used, designers and directors – indeed, the entire artistic team – find better ideas of how to make the most of the performing space. It was a genuine treat to see the chamber sized orchestra, high above the performing space below, with ConductorAntony Walkerhighlighted throughout. The gifted instrumentalists, lighting, projections, stage settings all combined for an entertaining evening that was gone – unfortunately – in a flash.
The music is contemporary opera. Melody is avoided wherever possible. Arias – anything wandering from declamation?  Out of the question, almost entirely. But the newness of the work and an enthusiastic cast of singers and musicians made for an exciting night. It must be said thatsingingis a largely missing feature of the work. A sparkling orchestral accompaniment, rich in percussion, carries the cast through spots tedious at times for lack of other than dry declamation.
Thomas (Fran Daniel Laucerica) threatens his mother Mona (Meredith Arwady)
And such voices on the stage. As the beleaguered Mona,Meredith Arwadycreated a role, made her local debut, and astonished the first night audience with a true contralto voice nothing short of remarkable. So remarkable, indeed, that it’s safe to say that such a voice has not been heard in Pittsburgh since Stephanie Blythe sang Verdi’s Amneris and Saint-Saëns’ Dalila here over a decade ago. Vocally, she poured her soul into the part, and acted the role with a sincerity that was riveting. Her return to Pittsburgh is to be hoped for. BassMatthew Soibelman, in the part of the Inspector, has a steadily resonant, rich and pleasing voice, but little other than recitatives to do here, and we’ll look forward to appearances he make in the future.
The work makes great demands on not one, but two, sopranos, andAudrey Welsh, (the Curator) andLauryn Davis(Momma), gave outstanding performances. TenorFran DanielLaucerica, as Thomas, the thief, delivered a captivating performance, acting and singing in a fashion that made hopes for his return to Pittsburgh Opera.

Home›Our Posts›Pittsburgh Opera’s newest world premiere, ‘Woman With Eyes Closed,’ has three different endings!
ByGeorge B ParousonApril 19, 2025•(0)
Season Finale Opens Saturday Under ‘Veil of Mystery‘
And it doesn’t matter which of the three endings we see and hear – we’ll never tell. But we can always count onChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications forPittsburgh Opera, to share thoughts with a cast member of each new production. This time round it’sAudrey Welsh, the bright mezzo-soprano and first year Resident Artist who will finish the 2024-25 season with more high hopes for what she’s proved from the instant she set foot on the local opera stage. And the rest went something like this…
Chris Cox: Audrey Welsh, welcome! Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Where you’re from, how did you first discover you were interested in opera, and what led you to Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program?
Audrey Welsh: I’m a mezzo-soprano from Houston, Texas. I started singing because of my mom. I was dead set on making my high school volleyball team my freshman year, and that wasn’t in the cards for me. My mom said, “Hey, the choir tryouts are the same day. Here’s $5. You should go audition for the choir.” She loves to say it’s the best $5 she’s ever spent, because I ended up getting into the choir, and then I begrudgingly stayed with it all four years. By my senior year, I was choir president and captain of the varsity choir. The bug bit me again, after I took a brief hiatus from performing in middle school because I thought I was too cool. It turns out I’m not.
My senior year of high school, I auditioned for the Houston Grand Opera’s Bauer Family High School Voice Studio. That was integral in my development, and led me to pursue my Bachelor of Music in Voice. That program definitely sling-shotted me into pursuing this professionally. I just totally fell in love with seeing all of the shows at Houston Grand Opera and haven’t looked back.
Audrey Welsh
CC: Well, I’ll look back for a second on your first season as a Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist. You had two very memorable roles at the Benedum Center, Lola inCavalleria Rusticana, and then Kate Pinkerton inMadama Butterfly. Can you tell us a little bit about each of those experiences, and whether you preferred one role over the other?
AW: Lola, being my professional AGMA debut, surrounded by such seasoned cast members, was just an absolute dream. I don’t think I could have written a better debut. It was the most fun role. I mean, who doesn’t love to play the other woman, who’s gorgeous in this corset and runs the stage when she walks on? She gets to come on for the big group number, and also has this sultry offstage singing. Plus my costume was fabulous.
Everyone inCavalleriawas so, so sweet and welcoming, especially Eve [Gigliotti], who was Santuzza. And singing in the Benedum Center for the first time, my God. It’s a 2,800-seat house. I had never sung anywhere that big before. So when it came to Kate Pinkerton inMadama Butterfly, I thought, “Oh yeah, I got this. I’ve been here before.” I’d come into this room as a woman about town as Lola; for Kate, I got to be a little more stoic.
InButterfly, I also got to do a silent scene, which is rarely done in opera. Getting to flex your acting muscle and holding the audience in the palm of your hand for that minute and a half at the opening of Act Two was just the coolest thing.
CC: Now you’re about to be in a world premiere,Woman With Eyes Closed. Can you tell us a little bit about your character and what her role is in the show?
AW: I have the privilege to play the Curator. I am the curator of a museum that has just been robbed. Our stage director Kristine McIntyre and I see her as young, probably my exact age, like in the infamous Isabella Stewart Gardner museum heist. She’s young, has just graduated with her master’s degree, and is trying to prove herself, so she’s a lot like me. And now this huge problem has fallen in her lap. It is her responsibility, and her problem, that two Picasso, two Monet, a Matisse, Gauguin, and a Lucian Freud have all been stolen from her museum.
In the score, she is only labeled as the Curator, as is the Inspector. Later in the show we do learn their actual names. They’re not unnamed, amorphous people, but I think it’s very purposeful by the librettist and composer that they are unnamed in the score because the Curator and the Inspector act as the Greek chorus, or public opinion, for the show.
You see her grow throughout the show. Initially, you can hear in her musical lines that she’s really nervous, because more than $50 million worth of art’s been stolen from her museum. [Composer] Jennifer Higdon’s done an absolutely amazing job of writing the dramatic intent into each of the vocal lines, and you can feel the Curator’s nervousness and antsiness to get the art back. But then slowly, throughout the show, her words and musicality change.
In scene seven, I have what I like to believe is the thesis statement of the show. It’s a sweeping vocal line, that I think really encapsulates the point of the show. She’s speaking to the Inspector about why the theft matters so much, even when there are many other crimes going on in the world; she validates that those are important too when the Inspector is talking about them, but she says, “These paintings don’t belong to me. They belong to everyone, and they’re proof of our humanity. And so if we lose this, then what do we have?” I feel honored to get to deliver that line to the audience.
CC:Woman With Eyes Closedis more intimate thanCavalleriaorButterfly. The venue is smaller, the orchestra’s smaller, there’s no big chorus, et cetera. As a cast member, does that change how you approach the role?
AW: Yes. You have to be really intentional about your facial expressions. That’s the case in any opera, but for a 2,800-seat house like the Benedum, it’s maybe not as important to focus so much on your microexpressions. But in a smaller space like this, with a more intimate story and the audience right in your face, you need to be really cognizant of how you’re saying your words and what words you want to emphasize.
Also, the Inspector, myself, and Thomas, who is the art thief, are going to have a live video feed in the show, which is a little jarring. Matt [Soibelman, who sings the role of the Inspector] and I are trying to act like we’re on TV giving a press conference. We’ve noticed in rehearsals that sometimes we tend to lean towards where Maestro is, so we look like we’re on a boat, tipping to the side, trying to catch Maestro’s eye. But we need to stay put and plant our feet, so I’m glad we’ve had the chance to practice it.
It’s never a good idea to sing with food stuck in your teeth, but for sure when there’s a camera and you’re going to be broadcast close up on the screen behind you for a whole room of people, you definitely want to make sure that there’s nothing in your teeth.
CC: So bring your floss to the dressing room.
AW: Exactly. But more seriously, the scale of this show provides a more real experience, especially with the smaller, more intimate orchestra. The audience will get up close and personal with the storytelling.
CC: What else does the audience have to look forward to in the show?
AW: Something very interesting indeed is that, depending on which day you come to the show, there will be a different ending. That’s very intriguing indeed, and a little tough on all our parts to get it all organized. Every time we rehearse the show, we run each ending to make sure that everything is ironed out and very pristine for each audience.
Also, something I definitely didn’t expect from a show about an art heist is to have the inclusion of the character of Mona’s Mom. Mona’s son Thomas is the one who has stolen the paintings. Thomas brings the paintings to his mother’s house. And then Mona takes a little nap, maybe, and has an out-of-body experience in a dream sequence where the memory of her own mother, who was a painter, is conjured.
I myself never expected to have such wonderful feelings about my own mother as I was watching the Momma and Mona scenes. I just moved here to Pittsburgh in September. I’d lived in Houston, Texas my whole life. And I miss my mom a lot, obviously. To watch a scene of someone getting to see their mother in a dream, whenever they’re physically apart by death or distance, is just so wonderful and is something you wouldn’t expect in a show about an art heist.
CC: Is your mom coming to one of the performances?
AW: She is coming to the Saturday matinee. My mom is going to come, and my brother and my sister-in-law, and my aunt, and a partridge in a pear tree. I think the whole state of Texas is going to get on a plane to come see this one. I’m so excited.
CC: We look forward to having them. I’m sure they’re going to love the show.

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
“Spectacle” is the word. Grand opera at its best is a spectacle—a presentation that floods the concert hall with soaring music, dynamic visual effects, and dazzling stagecraft, all coming together around a heart-rending saga. The current production of Puccini’sMadama Butterflyat Pittsburgh Opera (through March 30) gives you all that, while even adding a modern twist to the underlying story.
Soprano Karah Son, small in stature but with a powerfully pristine voice, delivers a scorching portrayal of a jilted bride in the title role. (She has sung it in more than 20 stagings ofButterflyinternationally). Moreover, Puccini’s score works as well as it ever did throughout. Time and again the orchestra shifts musical gears seamlessly to convey the changing moods and tensions of the tale.
At some points you hear, briefly, the tinkling echoes of traditional Japanese melodies. But those cheerful notes are swept away by the tragic fate that envelops a young woman who trusted her heart too much. And late in the opera, as she faces mounting evidence that her faithless husband won’t be coming home again, the tone is set by a musical device guaranteed to chill any listener’s spine. Amid the plaintive strains of violins come eerie human voices—the soft and wordless wailing of an offstage chorus, as if faraway sea-sirens are chanting a lost sailor’s doom.
The Backstory: a Bridge Between Eras and Cultures
Giacomo Puccini composed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. That was a time when high-art operatic conventions were giving way to, or at least being augmented by, new artistic approaches.Madama Butterfly, which premiered in Milan in 1904, bridged the old and new memorably.
Puccini was inspired to create the opera after seeing a play adapted from the American short storyMadame Butterfly. Eventually, working with librettists Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, he arrived at the version that would become a staple of the repertoire worldwide.
The setting is Nagasaki at the turn of the 20th century. Japan itself has entered a time of transition, opening up to foreign influences. As part of that opening-up, U.S. Navy ships frequent the harbor. And a teenaged Japanese girl, Cio-Cio-San, a.k.a. Butterfly, falls in love with a Yankee lieutenant bearing the ostentatiously American name Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton.
Pinkerton also is smitten, perhaps mainly by lust. He proposes marriage, despite knowing he’ll soon be called away on duty, which will give him an easy exit strategy: ”I can cancel any time,” he sings cockily. (Actually he sings in Italian, but the English translation projected above the stage at Benedum Center renders the wording used here.)
And sure enough, after a stormy wedding ceremony where Cio-Cio-San’s uncle protests the union—and after the young woman and the sailor enjoy a spell of connubial bliss—off sails Pinkerton, vowing to return someday, although someday might be never. The rest of the opera chronicles Cio-Cio-San’s steadfast waiting, accompanied by the child to whom she’s given birth. Her vigil goes cruelly unrewarded when Pinkerton’s ship finally steams into harbor, carrying the blonde woman he’s wedded back home in the States.
Is the message that American diplomacy can’t be trusted? That sooner or later you will find you’ve been, ahem, screwed? Quite possibly this is one theme that the opera suggests. The contemporary re-staging you’ll see in Pittsburgh seems to bring it home vividly.
A Classic Reimagined
TheMadama Butterflyat the Benedum adds a new framing to the story. Before the music begins, the lights go up on a set that’s the interior of a modern-day American condo unit. Pinkerton (tenor Eric Taylor) is no naval officer; he’s just a regular guy puttering around his pad in a t-shirt. But then he dons a VR headset. Now everything is transformed. Out of a decoration on the wall—a huge red disc like the rising sun on a Japanese flag—step two men in starchy white U.S. Navy uniforms. Out of therefrigeratorcomes a parade of persons in traditional Japanese garb. Thus Pinkerton is drawn into his virtual fantasy world, a world where he can be the bold seafaring dude who gets a lovely Nagasaki lover circa 1900.
Cue the orchestra. Sliding set-pieces shift to reveal the realm scripted by Puccini and company long ago. Going forward, we’re mainly inMadama Butterflyas the composer envisioned it. However, the journey will be punctuated by further flashes back to the condo, and to Pinkerton as a schlub with a headset. These flashbacks (flash-forwards?) tell us that the man truly loves his fantasy … and perhaps truly loves imaginary Cio-Cio-San more than the real American wife he’s stuck with.
Potential new interpretations therefore abound. This reviewer found them intriguing. I also found many other aspects of the production to be spot-on.
The Bro and the Consul
Taylor, the tenor playing Pinkerton, is not the sinuously seductive Casanova type who might sometimes be cast in such a role. He’s a big burly fellow, able to come across as sort of an average American bro. To me, the casting fits—I’ve had friends who could be this Pinkerton—and Taylor acts the role perfectly.
Equally perfect is baritone Nmon Ford as Sharpless, the American consul in Nagasaki. The role is a pivotal one. Consul Sharpless knowsfrom the get-go that Pinkerton is liable to ditch poor Butterfly, so he stridently warns the sailor not to do it, while at the same time he must maintain a diplomatic public stance as the representative of a foreign power. In modern terms, you might say Sharpless is caught in the position of a level-headed insider trying to do damage control while he watches things go awry. Ford plays the part to a T. And his costume is perfect. He’s clad in a flowing long coat dyed shimmering gold, which bespeaks his role as a delegate from the wealthy American empire.
Am I reading too much into details? I think not. Granted, you may come away with different readings. But regardless of how you slice it, thisMadama Butterflyis a unique experience—one that honors the original, and more.
Closing Credits and Ticket Info
Puccini’sMadama Butterflyis presented in a version co-produced by Pittsburgh Opera along with companies in Cincinnati, Detroit, and Salt Lake City. The creative effort was led by Japanese and Japanese-American theater artists, with Matthew Ozawa credited for the original concept.

ByGeorge B ParousonMarch 23, 2025•(0)
Huge Crowd on Hand for First Night of “Virtual Reality” Take on Puccini Classic
By George B. Parous
Whether it was a love of Puccini’s music, curiosity about the new production, or both, something drew the biggest opening night audience in recent memory to the Benedum for Pittsburgh Opera’sMadama Butterflylast evening. WhileMelanie Bacaling’s revival of Matthew Ozawa’s modern spin is indeed a revisionist take on the favorite opera, in the audience could be spotted a handful of patrons in traditional geisha attire. It was a fun crowd that sat silently spellbound through the entire first act before adding thunderous applause to the occasion, an ovation that was well deserved by all involved.
Much has been written and spoken of the new production, so an attempt to add anything new won’t be made here, aside from comment on the musical aspects heard last evening. One thing is certain, and that is anything but panoramic photography can’t do the staging any justice. Lighting, costumes, set design, direction – all are quite admirable and fill the entire Benedum performing space. The “virtual” aspects of the production, while obvious, aren’t enough to distract those who prefer the traditional, and the music certainly isn’t harmed in any way.
Cio-Cio-San (Karah Son) and her relatives
It was obvious from the start thatAntony Walkerand the orchestra were “on” for the night. Puccini’s rich orchestration received a lush performance. What new superlative adjectives can describe this remarkable body of musicians? UnderMark Trawka’s direction, the chorus delivered some of the most beautiful music of the entire evening. The off-stage intonements were ethereal and positively enchanting. A few of the choristers stepped forward in smaller roles, such asVeronika Schmidt(Cio-Cio-San’s Mother),Lilly Abreu(the Cousin) andChristina McCann(The Aunt), and Resident ArtistsErik Nordstrom(The Imperial Commissioner) andAudrey Welsh(Kate Pinkerton) made the most of their roles.
In her Pittsburgh Opera debut, sopranoKarah Sonmade a sterling first impression, and she seemed genuinely startled by the massive ovation she received at the opera’s conclusion. She should be used to such receptions by now, since she sings the role in a magnificent fashion, and by her own estimation has performed Cio-Cio-San hundreds of times in numerous productions. Her entrance was a magical mixture of soprano and choral tones. She gave a glorious interpretation of the role, building anticipation for what  she would do with the famous “Un bel dì, vedremo” aria, and she didn’t disappoint. Aside from a lack of carrying power in the brief lower passages of the part, her voice is ideally suited to Butterfly. Much the same may be said of mezzo-sopranoNozomi Katoin her local debut, even if her Suzuki is required to make her first appearance emerging from a refrigerator. Her voice and interpretation were an ideal match for the part, and her warm, velvety tones glide easily to the higher ranges.
Pinkerton (Eric Taylor, right) confides in US Consol Sharpless (Nmon Ford)
As Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton, tenorEric Tayloris also new to the local opera scene. His voice is notable for its powerful clarity, and he made a great success of the role’s comparatively limited opportunities. The part is by no means small, but at the Met’s 1907 American première of “Butterfly,” Enrico Caruso sulked in the wings while Puccini himself was on hand to watch. Taylor doesn’t seem like the sulking type, and his singing roused a mighty hand from the audience. BaritoneNmon Ford, last heard here in a production ofSalome, if memory serves, sang and acted the role of Sharpless, the U. S. Consul. His voice is rich and ringing and at its best in sustained passages, even if one or two of them lie too low for his range. He’s a convincing actor and made the most of his part.
A tiny charmer namedRisa Kozai, according to the program, won instant endearment as the little bit of “Trouble.” The dress rehearsal photo included here featuresRoy Santarella(who will rotate by performance with Risa) according to the information supplied by the photographer.
Suzuki (Nozomi Kato, left) and Cio-Cio San (Karah Son, right) play with Cio-Cio San’s son (Trouble, Roy Santarella)
Other small roles were handled effectively byYazid Gray(Yakusidé),Julius Ahn(Goro),Jacob Junbo Zhou(The Official Registrar and Prince Yamadori) andHyungjin Son(The Bonze); so effectively that they, too, came in for a fair share of recognition at the final curtain. That curtain was dropped with a finality far too soon – the audience reaction was going strong and by no means over when the lights came up.
All told, the production is an excellent one and will be repeated Tuesday, March 25 (7:00 PM); Thursday, March 27 (10:15 AM, the student matinee); Friday, March 28 (7:30) and Sunday, March 30 (2:00 PM).

ByGeorge B ParousonMarch 18, 2025•(0)
Melanie Bacaling, Stage Director, Discusses Production
Saturday evening, March 22,Pittsburgh Operawill give this season’s first performance of Puccini’s classicMadama Butterfly. In this new production, the story is moved to a  realm “where reality and dreams intersect.”Chris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, recently took the time to discuss the production with stage directorMelanie Bacaling, and shared with us the following transcript of their conversation:
Chris Cox: Melanie Bacaling, welcome to Pittsburgh.
Melanie Bacaling: Thank you so much for having me.
CC: Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you became an Opera Stage director?
MB: That is a bit of a winding road. I am originally from Chicago. I came to opera first through the singing lens, actually. I got my undergraduate degrees in psychology and vocal performance from the University of Evansville. And then in graduate school I got my master’s in vocal pedagogy and performance, thinking I was going to go more towards the teaching and singing route, focusing on voice science and rehabilitating injured singing voices.
But while I was in grad school, I started working closely with one of the directing faculty at the Boston Conservatory, Nathan Troop. I just absolutely fell in love with being on the other side of the table, and realized that big picture storytelling was something I really had my heart and eyes on. I’d always been into theater and that kind of storytelling. So I started taking the opportunities to be in rehearsal rooms. I was sweeping and mopping the floors of the Boston Lyric Opera rehearsal rooms so I could be there observing and watching how directors and conductors and singers work and interact. And from there, I ended up getting a few opportunities to stage manage and production assist and then worked my way up into assistant directing and now fully directing. On this production I am the Associate Revival Director. Matthew Ozawa, who originated the production, is a dear mentor and friend of mine.
So it was definitely by the grace of people letting me listen and ask and observe. I am very grateful for the path that I’ve had and feel very at home in what I get to do now, which is exciting.
CC:
From your perspective, why hasMadama Butterflyremained such a popular opera for over a hundred years?
MB:
I think it is most definitely the score. Puccini is such a descriptive composer. All of his operas give you the drama. No note is wasted, no instrument is wasted, it is all there. As a director, it is such a gift to be able to just trust the score and to know that the storytelling is inherently present.Madama Butterflyhas some of his most beautiful music; it really gets at the heart of the characters he’s created within the score. By and large, when you ask a lot of people about what their favorite opera is or what some of their favorite arias are, more often than not, you will hearMadama Butterflybeing referenced for the beauty of the music.
CC:
Can you tell us about this specific production that folks will come see. How and why is it different from a quote/unquote “traditional” production ofMadama Butterfly?
MB:
The framing container, which is what the directing and design team call it, that we’re telling the story in is rather modern. We see the story of Butterfly being told through the lens of this virtual reality world. Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and then he transforms into the Pinkerton avatar of the story and Butterfly comes to life. We are framing the story through the sort of white male gaze, and seeing how it can come to life, in a way that I think is actually truer to the story than previous framing devices.
We don’t change the score. The score is what it is, the libretto is what it is. If anything, we’ve made a couple of adaptations to the Japanese phrasing. For example, in the original libretto The Bonze says “Cio-Cio San”, but in Japanese culture it should actually be “Cio-Cio Yo” because he is an elder referring to a younger, so we changed that.
The way that this framing device works highlights the actual story in and of itself. It makes it come to life in a way that feels really present for a 2025 audience.
CC:
In a lot of our productions, the cast has either never worked together before, or if they have, it was in a different opera years ago. But for thisMadama Butterfly, a lot of the primary cast members have not just worked together before, but have been in this particular production ofMadama Butterflybefore. So on the one hand I think, “Oh, well that must make Melanie’s job a little bit easier. They’ve got this great head start already.” But then on the other hand, how do you guard against what could be a potential risk of complacency that can come from routine and familiarity?
MB:
It’s a gift that we get to continue to interrogate the piece. This particular cast, we have some folks who were with us in Cincinnati, which was the originating production, some folks who were with us in Detroit where it went shortly after, and some who were at both. This cast is like a hybrid of the two. And then we have some new folks here as well in some of the other roles. That forced Matthew and me to really ask ourselves, “Okay, did this moment really read? What do they remember? What do they not remember?” And to have honest conversations with each other. We’ve built our rapport together where we can say, “You know, actually I thought that this moment could be better with like this move and this thing.”
It was definitely a gift to be able to really create this fresh. And it feels like this is a third version of the production, where we’re staying honest with the original staging, but making sure that we’re all on the same page about adapting it. One of the incredible things about being able to work with a group of artists that you’ve been familiar with is, you feel comfortable making decisions together. Everybody knows the goal of the story and has done it before. They are incredible artists themselves; they’re able to keep it fresh, and willing to do more work to ask, “Does this actually read, or are we doing it just because you told us to do it?” It’s been a really great experience to revisitMadama Butterflywith all of them.
CC:
What makes this such a great show for people who are new to opera?
MB:
Puccini’s score is so descriptive that you get a lot of the story from the way that it’s written just organically. Also, the athleticism of the singers, and being able to really appreciate that power of the human voice. One of the greatest things about opera is that we get to witness the athleticism of an opera singer, which is the Olympian way of singing. Also, the way that we’re framing this particular story with our virtual reality world feels very accessible. It feels very modern with touch points that would feel present to someone being introduced to a new story for the first time. So, you’re getting all of the great qualities of your operatic experience through the singing and through the music combined with this storytelling device that keeps your brain and eyes fresh.
CC:
What other things do the audience have to look forward to at this show?
MB:
The design is absolutely a feast for the eyes. Our set design by Dots led by Kimie Nishikawa is absolutely stunning. The way we go from a small apartment into this fantasy room that actually has the appropriate Japanese proportions – she was so thoughtful in curating that world. The costumes and the hair and makeup by Maiko Matsushima. She drew from really incredible VR, manga, various Japanese visuals that really pop and bring the design to life. And then our lighting by Yuki Nakase Link just absolutely elevates all their designs already.Madama Butterflyis this visual feast; the first time I saw it all come together, I gasped.
CC:
What makes this production special for you?
MB:
It’s really significant to me. One of my favorite things about being part of this production has been the collaborative effort with the directing and design team. The way that Matthew has led this has really been collectivist in nature. We all sat together on Zoom before even getting to Cincinnati and really interrogated how we wanted to tell the story and how it made us feel represented or not represented.
And especially for our designers, Maiko and Kimie and Yuki, being Japanese women themselves and never feeling like they were adequately represented throughButterfly’s characters. To find a way to tell the story that makes them feel like they have ownership and power in this framing is so significant. The fact that so many people are responding really well to it and so many companies are supporting it, means the world to us. I am grateful to Pittsburgh Opera, to Cincinnati Opera, to Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera for being supporters of that storytelling and that truly genuine, adequate representation.

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
Christopher Hahn, who’s held top leadership roles at Pittsburgh Opera for a quarter of a century, is retiring at the end of next season, the Opera announced Thursday.
Hahn was hired as artistic director in 2000 and has served as general director since 2008.
“No single person is more responsible for Pittsburgh Opera’s many successes these past two-and-a-half decades than Christopher Hahn,” says Pittsburgh Opera board chair Michele Fabrizi. “His vision and dedication are truly second to none.”
In a press release, the Opera credited Hahn with expanding the 76-year-old company’s repertoire by introducing Baroque and contemporary works. The troupe also produced three world premieres in recent years, including 2017’s “The Summer King — the Josh Gibson Story” (about the Pittsburgh baseball great) and 2022’s “In a Grove.”
He also built up the Opera’s Resident Artist training program, which now routinely receives more than 800 applications for a handful of slots each year.
He also oversaw the group’s move from Downtown to its current permanent home in former George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory, in the Strip District, in 2008. And he led the troupe through the pandemic, during whose height the group managed to become one of the few performing arts organizations in the country to hold live, indoor performances for in-person audiences.
Hahn, a native of South Africa, began his career in opera in 1983. Before joining Pittsburgh Opera, he held management positions at the San Francisco Opera Center and Los Angeles Opera.
Pittsburgh Opera’s final production during his tenure will be“Falstaff,” its season-closernext year and famed composer Giuseppe Verdi’s final opera. The group will also honor Hahn at its Maecenas Gala, set for May 16.
The group said in a statement it has hired a consultant to search for Hahn’s replacement, whom it expects to announce in early 2026.

Home›Our Posts›Pittsburgh Opera – Joseph Haydn’s “Armida”
ByGeorge B ParousonJanuary 29, 2025•(0)
“Baroque” Rarity is Being Presented With Powerful Vocal Cast in Effective Staging
By George B. Parous
Pittsburgh Operagave the second performance of Joseph Hadyn’sArmidalast evening, at theCAPAauditorium, and it was an outstanding example of the company’s commitment to presenting rarely heard music, performed by talented young singers with a first-class orchestral accompaniment. The production is mounted from the floor up by the company, and is effective, with a little imagination, in showcasing the music – probably new to most of the audience – and the music in this work is most definitely the thing. And the amount of talent available for these first local performances of Haydn’s opera is quite remarkable.
Armida (Lauryn Davis)
For brevity, the program’s capsulation of the 1784 opera will do nicely. “To prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, the Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida’s spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both?” A mighty plot for a single-set production, indeed, but again, Haydn’s music, and the performers pouring it from the stage, draw focus directly to the singers and orchestra. As is usually the case,Antony Walkerand the orchestra gave an almost seamless delivery of the opera’s beautiful orchestration.
Armida (Lauryn Davis) pleads with Rinaldo (Fran Daniel Laucerica)
In the title role, sopranoLauryn Davisis making her Pittsburgh Opera debut. She gives a fierce, commanding performance of the part, with a voice of remarkable power and quality. More than once she astonished with a brilliant display of vocal pyrotechnics that almost shook the rafters of the theater. TenorFran Daniel Laucerica, in the role of Rinaldo, showed great stamina, and sang with agility a part which requires nearly non-stop vocalization, and makes its most demanding requirements in the third, final act. He rose quite well to the occasion.
Idreno (Matthew Soibelman) has a nymph (Melissa Burke, courtesy of Attack Theatre) remove Clotarca (Audrey Welsh) from his presence
Shannon Crowley, the lyric soprano we heard off-stage as the shepherd inTosca, gave atour de forceperformance of the Act III scene and aria of Zelmira. BassMatthew Soibelman, also heard briefly inTosca, resonated in the role of King Idreno. His voice is sonorous and of great range and carrying power.Erik Nordstrom, in the role of Ubaldo, again displayed a fine, warm baritone and dramatic abilities that made him a standout.Audrey Welsh, mezzo-soprano, as she did in the autumn inCavalleria Rusticana, displayed vocal and dramatic prowess in the “pants role” of Clotarca. Three dancers courtesy ofAttack Theatre–Melissa Burke,Anya EpsteinandOlivia Nellis– wove through the action in what for the main part were interpretive gyrations which helped the story along.
Zelmira (Shannon Crowley) poses a question to Clotarca (Audrey Welsh)
Two performances remain – Friday evening, January 31, at 7:30, and Sunday afternoon, February 2, at 2:00. Tickets are scarce, but for information about seat availability, full production details and more, visitPittsburgh Opera.

📰 n exhilarating introduction to what this art form can offer" -- Pittsburgh Quarterly
🔗 https://pittsburghquarterly.com/articles/pittsburgh-operas-armida-sings-in-a-language-beyond-words/
📄 Nội dung bài viết:
The French New Wave director Francois Truffaut once remarked of Alfred Hitchcock that he was the only director who did not require sound for his films to be understood; in other words, the effect of his visual narrative was so strong that dialogue was not really necessary.  In much the same way, I found in watching–or I should say, listening to–Pittsburgh Opera’s performance of “Armida,” that I did not really need to read the English supertitles, sung in Italian, which were projected over the stage.  Because the emotional impact of this drama was self-evident in the delivery by the superb cast, such that reading the libretto took me out of the reverie of what these characters were experiencing and conveying in a musical language that did not require literal translation.That said, if you’re not an opera aficionado, this 1784 work by the Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn would be an exhilarating introduction to what this art form can offer.  You can either choose to follow the story–loosely based on a fictionalized account of a love story set during the First Crusade, as envisioned in the 1581 poemGerusalemme liberata, by Torquato Tasso–or simply recline in your seat, letting the rapture of the singers and the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra, conducted by Anthony Walker, envelope you.
Playing the title role, soprano Lauryn Davis evokes the sometimes brightly tortured, sometimes darkly ecstatic nature of her character–a sorceress sent to seduce a Christian knight–through the ethereal quality of her voice: she has the melancholic interiority of someone who just stepped out of a Caspar David Friedrich painting.  Ms. Davis captures the subtle antimony of her role–is Armida intrinsically good or evil, we’re never sure–in such a way that whenever she looks into the abyss of her existence, she tries to fill it with the light of her voice, rather than the tragedy of her despair. Brilliantly serving as the counterpart to her amorous vacillations, tenor Fran Daniel Laucerica invests the male lead of Rinaldo with a heroic vocal intensity.  Is he a stoic soldier of the 11thcentury, or a sensitive man of the 21st?  In either case, he offers a consistently powerful performance, even as he maintains the inscrutability of a character torn between love and duty, again and again.
Completing the remarkably strong cast are bass Matthew Soibelman (Idreno), high-baritone Erik Nordstrom (Ubaldo), mezzo-soprano Audrey Welsh (Clotarca), and soprano Shannon Crowley (Zelmira).
Kejia Yu’s set gives us permission to enter the world of fantasy, but without traveling too far; it features a stone tunnel structure that could have been lifted directly from New York City’s Central Park, as well as two trees and assorted hanging vines that look like vestiges from a JRR Tolkien story.  Mary Ellen Stebbins’ lighting designs are fantastical and evocative, melding with the physical aspects of the set in an organic–and psychologically pregnant–way.
Also adding to the flavor of the production in the role of nymphs are three dancers from Attack Theater: Melissa Burke, Anya Epstein, and Olivia Nellis, who flitter around the action in id-like animation of Armida’s psyche.
Yinxue Wang’s costume designs exude a lush, Pre-Raphaelite sense of enchantment to these souls, trapped in a story that forces them to navigate between the machinations of love and war, as well as myth and reality.
I won’t comment on the ending of the drama, which is better experienced in performance than summary; however, it’s not predictable, and this makes the experience all the more fulfilling.  Whether you come for the sublime music, the vocal artistry, the scintillating imagery, or just for the chance to escape into the dream-like, lost world of chivalric poetry, “Armida” will reward you, especially if you just close your eyes and listen to a sonorous language that needs no translation.
ARMIDA continues through February 2nd, CAPA School Theater, Downtown, $32.50-60,www.pittsburghopera.orgor 412-281-0912

Home›Our Posts›Feature Stories›Next Offering From Pittsburgh Opera Will Be First Local Performances of Haydn’s ‘Armida’
ByGeorge B ParousonJanuary 20, 2025•(0)
Company Will Mount New Production With Lauryn Davis Singing the Title Role
This Saturday, January 25, at the CAPA Theater,Pittsburgh Operawill present the first local performance of Joseph Haydn’s best known work,Armida.Even the composer considered it his best work. Singing the title role will be Resident ArtistLauryn Davis, in her company debut. Ms. Davis recently was named a District Winner at the Tennessee District of the Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition.
As he always does,Chris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, kindly took time out of his hectic schedule to interview Ms. Davis exclusively for onStage Pittsburgh. And here’s the interview –
Chris Cox:
Welcome Lauryn! Could you start by telling us a little bit about yourself and how you found your way to Pittsburgh Opera?
Lauryn Davis:
I’m from Atlanta, Georgia. I started studying opera in high school. I went to Kennesaw State for my undergrad. I graduated during Covid, unfortunately, took a gap year, and then went to CCM [University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music] for my Master’s. I graduated in April 2024, then I auditioned for Pittsburgh Opera, and they gave me a call.
C C:
What did you do during your gap year?
L D:
I taught group piano lessons to kids from Kindergarten through second grade. I taught the kids keys, and it was cute. It was throughFine Arts Matter
C C:
Sounds like a great experience.Armidais going to be your company stage debut, but obviously you’ve been doing other things with Pittsburgh Opera since you arrived here in the fall. What else have you been doing since you got here?
L D:
I studied and covered Nedda inPagliacci. We’ve been doing a lot of runouts and singing engagements throughout the community, at retirement homes and Children’s Hospital and places like that. Our Holiday Song Shop concert was my favorite.
C C:
There was also a little something called the Laffont Competition that you entered over the holidays in Tennessee. Can you tell us about that?
L D:
Yes, I competed in the Metropolitan Opera competition, and I won the district in Knoxville, Tennessee, on January 4th. I’m really excited about that, to take the win and represent Pittsburgh Opera.
C C:
Congratulations! What is the next step in that process?
L D:
We move to Regionals, which is in Atlanta, my hometown, on February 9th. I’m so excited to go home and sing in front of my family and friends. If I win that round, then I go to the semifinals in New York. So, fingers crossed.
C C:
We’re all cheering for you, and it’s great that you’ll have the hometown crowd behind you. Tell us a little bit about your character in this opera, Armida. The show is named after her, so she must be important. Who is she?
L D:
Armida is a sorceress, she’s very powerful. She’s the niece of Idreno, the king of the Damascus. She doesn’t need a title to know that she has a lot of power and a lot of sway in the kingdom.
Armida casts a spell on Rinaldo, one of the crusaders that’s invading her kingdom. She ends up having a relationship with him. They eventually fall in love with each other.
C C:
Even though they’re supposed to be enemies?
L D:
Yes, they’re supposed to be enemies, because the crusaders are coming in to take over and to take down the kingdom. There’s a conflict of interest between Rinaldo and Armida. She casts a spell on him, and I don’t know what it is about Rinaldo, but he and Armida have something, like a kinship. Something attracts them to each other. They both cannot let each other go.
C C:
What is it like to play this character?
L D:
It’s expanding my comfort zone – I’m not used to playing a witch of any kind. I usually play the lovey-dovey characters. This singing is also very different for me; it’s been very fun to tap into that. And luckily, our stage director Haley Stamats has been encouraging and caring with me through this process.
C C:
What do you want to bring to this role?
L D:
I want to bring some depth, and I want to bring some relatability to Armida. Everyone can relate to love, and how love can really take us out, and both really bring us up and bring us really down. I want to bring that relatability. I want the audience to see that she’s just a girl who, though she’s a sorceress and she’s so powerful, is still a woman who falls in love with a man.
C C:
How are the rehearsals going?
L D:
Rehearsals are going really well. We’re moving right along; Haley’s been very clear and concise, and collaborative. It’s been fun to collaborate with the director, it’s been great.
C C:
Is this your first time singing in a Haydn opera?
L D:
Yes, this is my first Haydn as well. I haven’t sung a lot of early music, so this is the most I’ve tapped into it. And I like it. I’ve always liked early music, especially Jeanine De Bique, I love her.
C C:
What does the audience have to look forward to in this show?
L D:
Great singing, the set is really nice, and a really good story. I think the audience will enjoy the themes of the show, and get into the drama, and be on the edge of their seats.
C C:
What are some things that make this show particularly compelling?
L D:
The drama, and the way Haydn has set the music, and how the characters all respond to each other – the chemistry with everyone on set. We all get along very well, and it’s nice to actually see that magic through our characters.
I’m excited for people to seeArmida. I’m excited to share the gift of music with others, and show Armida for who she is.

As a kid, fall weekends often started with a sleepover at a friend’s house. We’d stay up too late playing board games or just horsing around in the basement. When morning came, we’d have endless bowls of sugary cereal, walk to the drugstore for candy and then go to the movies for a double feature (which also included cartoons, a serial reel, and sometimes a yo-yo contest.) In fact, I don’t recall ever going to a Saturday matinee that wasn’t a double feature. I can still remember the stop-action animation of sword-fighting skeletons attackingJason and The Argonautsor the herculean teams of Norsemen rowingThe Long Ships.Everything about Saturdays was gluttonous. Never just one bowl of Sugar Pops, not just one Clark Bar or a single Reese’s Cup, and then, always, two movies and more. What joy! What sinful gluttony!
Such is the adult thrill of experiencing two operas in one evening. Pittsburgh Opera’s double feature ofCavalleria RusticanaandPagliacciis a sweet treat for aficionados of soaring arias and serious orchestration.
Two for One
Often paired together for reasons of sharing an identical set filled with a secondary cast of common townsfolk,Cavalleria RusticanaandPagliaccialso share a style of operatic storytelling calledverismo(as in verisimilitude) in which the librettist calls on everyday characters to fulfill the tragedy soon to unfold. There are no kings or princesses to confront their deserved comeuppances; no scheming divas or aristocratic asses to suffer their certain fate. Inopera verismo,we experience the jealousy, adultery, greed and vengeance of common villagers going about their lives looking for love and, often with disastrous result, dealing with their destinies.
Cavalleria Rusticana,Pietro Mascagni’s best known opera,is the simple story of a young woman (Santuzza) whose one-time lover (Turrido) has been fooling around with a former lover, but now another’s newlywed bride (Lola). Santuzza confronts Turrido and begs him to stop the tryst, but is flatly rejected. Crestfallen, she informs the young groom (Alfio) who challenges Turrido to a duel. All of the action, which unfolds outside the village church on Easter, falls to the ears of Turrido’s mother, Mamma Lucia, whose sympathies are torn between celebrating the town’s favorite holy day or interfering in her son’s illicit affairs.
Ensemble Extraordinaire
Santuzza (Eve Gigliotti) won’t hear what her former lover Turrido (Rafael Davila) has to say about her broken heart in ‘Cavalleria Rusticana.’
Eve Gigliotti, in her Pittsburgh Opera debut as Santuzza, takes the stage by sheer force of her compelling voice which is both fresh and full. She is a serious soprano playing a sincere Santuzza. As Mamma Lucia, Marianne Cornetti is a voice of great fidelity and effect. Mamma Lucia may not know the “full story,” but Cornetti knows her role cold and gives a truly warm and empathic performance. As Turrido, Rafael Davila (also in his debut with the Pittsburgh Opera) shines with less swagger than sensibility, while Sebastian Catana as Alfio offers his rich baritone to avenge both the honor of his wife, Lola, and his pride. Lola, as her name has come to imply, is a beauty who must offer a stage presence no less powerful than her voice. Audrey Welsh delivers both with polish and panache. This is a fine ensemble of well trained talent, yet what drives this short opera to an even higher level of satisfaction is the large cast that makes this Sicilian village lively. More than forty supernumeraries play various roles of school children, elders, priests, acolytes, and country women. Much of this talent is credited to the production’s chorus, yet also to the Pittsburgh Youth Chorus. Unlike smaller companies, Pittsburgh Opera is fortunate to fill its stage to full effect. (After all, great stories cannot “sail” without a crew and Jason would be no one—and nowhere—without his Argonauts!)
Turrido (Rafael Davila) confides in his mother, Mamma Lucia (Marianne Cornetti), that he can’t bare to lose his first love.
Don’t Trifle with the Truth
That same populated proscenium also works wonders inPagliacci, Leoncavallo’s famous short opera wherein Canio the Clown cries the tears of a lovesick man brutally betrayed. Rare in operatic storytelling,Pagliaccibegins with a prologue performed by one character. Tonio, a hunchbacked street actor, lets us know that the upcoming performance is about as real as it gets. This is a slice of life, he tells us, bitter but true. So, when the curtain rises, we immediately accept the honesty of a small town whose common folk are excited to attend a commedia dell’arte street performance that evening. In fact, we accept the truth because (however inadvertent to Leoncavallo’s libretto) we know this place and these paisan; they are all the same from our evening’s previous opera. And here, in the same town square, a troupe of traveling clowns have gathered to do what actors do best backstage: they gossip. Rumor has it, says Tonio, that Canio’s much younger wife, Nedda, has fallen for a handsome young villager. Canio tells his actors not to play around with innuendo; this is real life, he declares, and no one should trifle with his true love for Nedda. But Tonio takes advantage of his suspicions and blackmails Nedda for a kiss. Nedda defends herself forcefully. And, well—to make a short opera shorter—Tonio seeks revenge by spying on Nedda, learns the truth, and tells Canio. In an aria made famous in countless TV commercials, in Saturday cartoons, and in episodes of both “The Simpsons” and “Seinfeld,”Canio laments“Ridi, Pagliaccio,”the phrase that evokes the irony of a man who must “play the clown” even though his heart is breaking. Thus ends the first act.
In the second (and much shorter) act, the troupe of clowns put on their last performance for these townsfolk. The comedy they play is all too similar to the “real” story we have just seen unfold. And, without need for a spoiler alert, both the opera and the comedy-within-the-play come to a tragic ending.
Send in the Clowns
Village paisan await the scene change for a commedia dell’arte show soon to unfold. They may hope to laugh, but a great tragedy will bring down the “final curtain.”
BravoTonio, played heroically by Sebastian Catana (he who has just performed Alfio inCavalleria Rusticana.) Catana is the only artist to perform dual roles in Pittsburgh Opera’s current double feature. A baritone that booms, Catana sets the professional level to which his company must all rise. And they do. Nedda, performed by Caitlin Gottimer, a celebrated alumna of Pittsburgh Opera’s resident company, is outstanding. And, in fact, she stands out of the crowd, decrying the freedom birds have that she does not, in an aria unlike any other in this  evening’s presentation. It’s both joyous and sad; her soprano carries each beautifully.
Jonathan Burton, a favorite of Pittsburgh Opera and recent Cavaradossi in last month’sTosca, polishes his plum role inPagliaccias Canio. Audiences for Leoncavallo’s signature piece regularly anticipate the arietta of “Ridi, Pagliccio” and so it’s no easy piece to carry off without some sense of self-consciousness. Burton nailed it. Exceptional, too, are Fran Daniel Laucerica as Beppe/Arlecchino (also a standout in the recentTosca) and Ricardo Jose Rivera as Silvio, debuting with the Pittsburgh Opera as the handsome young villager who’s attracted Nedda’s interest. And, without apology, again, the contributions of forty townsfolk who make the Benedum stage a true village and, in so doing, add inordinate value to the meaning ofopera verismocannot be underscored. InPagliacci, several additional players also juggle, tumble, stilt-walk, dance and contort for the very effect a clown show adds to this circus. BooglepLex Circus is credited for this collective talent, deservedly so.
Silvio (Ricardo Jose Rivera) steals a moment with Nedda (Caitlin Gotimer) who has more to offer him than some circus souvenirs.
Bring Your Village
Pittsburgh Opera’s double-feature of “Cav / Pag” is no less than a gluttonous evening of rich music and soaring voice. Parents intending to enjoy this welcome evening should really consider bringing their teen children along with them for several reasons. First, it’s a double- feature and neither opera, both short and sweet, requires a preface of plot. Secondly, many who might never have attended any opera will likely know and enjoy these musical treats: theIntermezzoofCavalleria Rusticanais part of the signature score of Scorcese’sGodfather: Part III,and the arietta “Ridi, Pagliaccio” is a cult fave. And last, but not least of all, Pittsburgh Opera’s production features an amazing set, including Italian villas, shopfronts, a cathedral, and town stairs gorgeously lit by a scrim of brilliant colors establishing sunsets and, well, timeimmemorial.Finally, they also offer tickets at just $15. There’s no such thing as a cineplex offering two movies (let alone a double feature) for less. And, yes, you can buy sugary treats, too. Pittsburgh Opera’s double feature ofCavalleria RusticanaandPagliacciis onstage at the Benedum through November 17. The Sunday November 17 matinee performance offers free childcare for children two to twelve.
Bravo, Bravo
Offstage and in the orchestra pit talent abounds in this production. Conductor Antony Walker and the Pittsburgh Opera orchestra are exceptional. Unto themselves, without a cast, they are worth the evening’s ticket. Both operas are stage directed by Daniel Rigazzi. Scenic design is by Steven C. Kemp. Edward Kotanen designed costumes and James Geier designed wigs and make-up. The lighting designer is Cindy Limauro. Cindy Knight managed the stage, with the assistance of Bee Anderson and Tess Naval. Chorus master is Mark Trawka.

ByGeorge B ParousonNovember 10, 2024•(0)
Grand Performances by Singers, Orchestra, Chorus, Acrobats and More
By GEORGE B PAROUS
A good-sized crowd was on hand at the Benedum last night, whenPittsburgh Operagave the first performance of theirCavalleria RusticanaandPagliaccidouble-header production. Both operas were well worth hearing, but in fairness it must be said that the second opera came off better than the first. Still, anything conducted byAntony Walkeris grand opera at it best, and the overall impression made last night was success, richly rewarded by long sustained, hearty applause. At the final curtain of the night, the audience had more than the singers, orchestra and splendid chorus to applaud. Truly astonishing feats by acrobats and stilt-walking jugglers from theBooglepLex Circusawed the crowd and, alone, are well worth the admission price. Beautiful music, richly performed, was the atmosphere of the night, and if individual performances by any of the singers seem perfunctory, it is only due to time and space. The stage wallowed in a wealth of vocal talent.
Cavalleria Rusticana, to a large extent, needs a brilliant orchestra and chorus. It got more than both last night and then some. So didPagliacci. Antony Walker has been noted on numerous occasions for being the splendid conductor he is, and last night he gave yet another example of what he and the orchestra can deliver. It was another display, in both operas, and, barring a few unfortunate slips, of the powerful and precise accompaniments these instrumentalists can be counted on to give. The chorus, directed byMark Trawka, and augmented by thePittsburgh Youth Chorus, gave brilliant accounts of themselves, especially in the swelling climaxes. The supernumeraries and actors, like the chorus, were brilliantly costumed and very impressive. One point on the costuming drew an amusing question, overheard. Why were Sicilian peasant women wearing such high-heeled shoes? Even two nuns were wearing them.
Turiddu (Rafael Davila) has a request of his mother Mamma Lucia (Marianne Cornetti)
VeteranMarianne Cornetti, in the role of Mamma Lucia, managed to run away with the show and dominated the stage with her every appearance. She sang like the seasoned vocal artist she is, and managed to command the eye’s attention even when she wasn’t singing. Mezzo-sopranoEve Gigliotti, as the haplessSantuzza, sang with velvety smoothness when she wasn’t forcing her tones, which was frequently the case. But she wasn’t the only one who seemed to fear they might not be heard over the orchestra. TenorRafael Davila, who made much of the role of Turiddu, also showed a tendency to force his otherwise brassy tones. Both Gigliotti and Davila made their Pittsburgh Opera debuts.
Audrey Welsh, a first-year Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist, made her debut in the role of Lola. She was a crowd pleaser, making the most of her brief opportunities with a smooth and velvety mezzo-soprano voice and fine stage appearance. BaritoneSebastian Catana, the only singer to appear in both operas, sang and acted the role of Alfio in strong and reverberating tones.
Santuzza (Eve Gigliotti, left) does not want to hear what Turiddu (Rafael Davila) has to tell her
Turiddu (Rafael Davila) toasts his married mistress Lola (Audrey Welsh)
InPagliacci, even better things came. As Canio, the hot-blooded clown, tenorJonathan Burtonreturned to give a performance that gave Pittsburgh Opera ample proof that he should be engaged as often as possible. His full-bodied, rich voice rang out resoundingly – never forced – and he happily avoided the temptation to overdo the laugh and sob effects in the role’s famous “Vesti la giubba” aria. SopranoCaitlin Gotimer, well known to Pittsburgh opera aficionados, returned to sing the beautiful music of Nedda, the equally hot-blooded wife of Canio. “Gotimer is a force of nature,”Broadway Worldhas called her. Last night she sang gloriously. The tension between her Nedda and Burton’s Canio was palpable. Her interpretation of the role’s famous “bird” aria was a highlight of the evening.
Nedda (Caitlin Gotimer)
TenorFran Daniel Laucerica, who returned to the stage as Beppe, gave a delightful performance, both by his singing and his comic stage deportment. He’s definitely proved himself as one of the finest tenors that the company’s Resident Artists program has delivered to Pittsburgh audiences. Sebastian Catana’s second performance of the night, as the passionate, sinister Tonio, sang the prologue before the curtain with a tendency to force, but gave a gripping account of the role’s music after the curtain went up. BaritoneRicardo José Rivera, sang and presented a Silvio who easily explained Nedda’s fascination.Sean DonaldsonandLogan Williams, as peasants, quite capably rounded out the cast. It should also be noted that, as brilliant as the chorus and supernumeraries were in the first opera, they were even more so in the second.

Overall, this is a production that shouldn’t be missed. The operas will be repeated, as usual, Tuesday evening, November 12; Friday evening, November 15, and the Sunday matinee, November 17.

📰 ecidedly delicious" -- Entertainment Central Pittsburgh

📄 Nội dung bài viết:
Pittsburgh Opera’s production of Tosca offers a stunning tableau of dramatic contrasts. As Sant’Andrea’s Te Deum devoutly begins, Baron Scarpia (on scaffold) unleashes his vile scheme.
One of the delights of opera is that most plots are simple. Classic opera tends toward pure melodrama. The hero rescues his love interest and vanquishes the villain. The formula is to be expected as tradition because it can be as comforting as macaroni and cheese or meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Either can be made more interesting with, perhaps, some crisp bacon, or a dash of hot sauce. But the basic recipe should offer no surprise unto itself. And, yet,TOSCA, Puccini’s classic opera about a diva who must rescue her lover, is a story baked in a very different oven. And it’s decidedly delicious. Pittsburgh Opera’sToscais onstage at Benedum Center through October 13.
Intriguing Entrees
Why? One reason is the entire storyline takes place in less than 24-hours. That dramatic conceit is not meant to drive the action. No bomb will explode if not diffused in less than seven minutes; no young princess is doomed to become an ugly hag at the stroke of midnight. Rather, the clock is employed to frame the tragedy of the story. The entire course of events takes place from one day to early dawn of the next as if to express to the audience “Can you believe this all could unfold so quickly?” It’s not so much a question as it is an exclamation. And that makes the story ofToscaall the more compelling. Sure, there are lively, lingering arias that dwell on love and yearning, and contrasting duets that confirm conflicts of character. But no one is rushing to the final act. Yet, once the audience gets there, well, it’s rather impressive to consider all that’s happened.
Diva Floria Tosca (Ana María Martínez) comforts her lover Cavaradossi (Jonathan Burton), confessing her resolve to his intended fate: death by firing squad.
A second reason is character. In storybook melodrama, the heroine is sweet and innocent and the villain is dark and mean-spirited. For example, sweet, innocent Nell is tied to the railroad tracks by Snidely Whiplash only because that’s what villains do. Nell cries for anyone’s help. Dudley Do-Right “does right” by Nell, not for love but because she’s in danger. (Actually, Nell loves Dudley’s horse, but that’s getting off track.) InTosca, however, Puccini’s characters are all fully expressed. The diva, Floria Tosca, is a true “diva” by modern denotation. She well might love the painter Cavaradossi, but, boy, is she jealous of his attention. She has enormous faith in the Madonna, but not much trust in her artist-lover. Yet, as the formula for melodrama begs, she does everything in her powers to rescue him. And of the dastardly Baron Scarpia, our story’s necessary villain, the “V” stands for vile. Justice nor revenge have anything to do with his motives. Lechery and lust drives his libido for which the audience has real reason to hate him. And that makes this operatic dish of love and lust, of faith and fidelity, all the more tasty.
A Recipe for Revenge
Of course, there’re many more reasons to loveTosca, but for those unfamiliar with Puccini’s opera (first performed in 1900 and tangentially based on historic events of 1800), the drama unfolds when the artist Mario Cavaradossi, while painting a portrait of Mary Magdalene in the church of Sant’Andrea della Valle, is confronted by Cesare Angelotti, an escaped prisoner hiding in the chapel. They are old friends and, as such, Cavaradossi intends to keep him safe. Even when his lover, Floria Tosca, the beloved diva of the Roman town arrives, Angelotti’s hiding is kept a secret. Naturally, Tosca becomes suspicious. Is Cavaradossi hiding something? Why does the portrait of Madonna not look more like Tosca herself? And just who did model for the image Cavaradossi is now painting? Her jealousy is both jarring and jaw-dropping. Tosca exits before Cavaradossi slips Angelotti away to safer hiding grounds. Seconds later, Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, and his henchmen, Spoletta and Sciarrone, rush into the church to seek the escaped prisoner. Scarpia discovers a woman’s fan. When Tosca returns to the church, Scarpia shows her the evidence that Cavaradossi must be hiding something. As he himself is in love with Tosca, Scarpia begins to scheme that he can turn her away from Cavaradossi, uncover the truth, and satisfy his infatuation for the diva. The first act ends as a church choir assembles––along with clergy, priests, and a cardinal––to celebrate their faith, an act against which Puccini cleverly juxtaposes the rampant jealousy both Scarpia and Tosca are each wont to show.
Satisfaction Sated
Painter Caravadossi (Jonathan Burton) is repulsed by Baron Scarpia’s (Kyle Albertson) accusations of subterfuge; his henchman Spoletto (Fran Daniel Laucerica) awaits orders to torture the artist.
Performing the role of Cavaradossi is tenor Jonathan Burton, a passionate and powerful voice with which he commands both attention and sympathy in this demanding role. Baritone Erik Nordstrom makes his Pittsburgh Opera debut in the role of the escapee, Angelotti. Necessarily, his appearance is brief, but memorable. As Floria Tosca, Ana María Martínez owns the stage, both deliberate in her range and polished in presentation. This, too, is her debut with the Pittsburgh Opera, despite a significant career with the Los Angeles Opera and many other companies. A Grammy winner, she is also a Professor of Voice at Rice University, both professional acclamations evidenced by her incredible performance. Perhaps most impressive is baritone Kyle Albertson as Baron Scarpia. His villainous role, of course, is over the top, but Albertson carries it with refined composure and breath-taking energy. Two more performers are worth great applause. As the church sacristan, Brian Kontes brings a purposeful humility to his baritone, truly befitting his stage role. And, as Spoletta, Fran Daniel Laucerica is riveting as Scarpia’s obedient sidekick. His tenor voice is only overshadowed by his authoritative stage presence. Like many classic operas, there are also many, too many supporting voices to mention. The Pittsburgh Opera does not shy away from filling the stage, in this case with military guards, choristers, and a full clergy, not to mention passers-by, court attendees, judges and jury. They deserve much of the applause for a spectacular production.
Tosca (Martínez) turns the tables on Baron Scarpia (Albertson) who must beg for his own miserable life.
Exceptional Contributors
Toscaunfolds in three acts, each set in a distinct location as the action drives on to an early morning showdown. The scenery for this production is truly stunning, and, although constructed by the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, appears as if designed for the Benedum stage. Keith Brumley, set designer, earns great accolades, as does lighting designer Abigail Hoke-Brady for affecting the ebb and flow of daylight with appropriate subtlety. Costumer Andrew Marley whose designs originated for the New York City Opera production ofToscapresents some remarkable work, particularly with Baron Scarpia. The Pittsburgh audience may have noted, too, the “holy” iridescence of the clergy’s robes and miters.
Tara Faircloth directed this Pittsburgh stage with evident attention to blocking and movement. For example, Act Two, in which Scarpia plays on Tosca’s distress requires both characters to sweep from left to right, and back again, as Caravadossi’s torture is heard offstage. Simply stated, the scene is choreographed magnificently.As if saving the best for last, the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra is always, and again, a highlight of every production. Conductor Antony Walker is a star among sixty-four credited musicians for Tosca.
With music by Giacomo Puccini and a libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, Pittsburgh’s production ofToscais stage managed by Cindy Knight, with the assistance of Bee Anderson and Tess Naval. Dana Kinney assisted in stage direction. James Geier designed the wigs and make-up. Tonya R. Lynn directed the fight scene with assistance from Anne Ramatt. Assistant Conductor is Glenn Lewis, Chorus Master is Mark Trawka, and associate coach and pianist is James Lesniak, who worked along with resident artist pianist, Maeve Berry.Performances ofToscawill carry forward on October 8, 11, and 13 at Benedum Center, Cultural District, Downtown.

Home›Our Posts›Pittsburgh Opera Launches 2024-25 Season With a Production of ‘Tosca’
ByGeorge B ParousonOctober 6, 2024•(0)
Outstanding Performance of Tried and True Standard by Giacomo Puccini Shows the Composer and Company at Their Best
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Pittsburgh Operaopened their new season last night at the Benedum, with a performance of Puccini’sToscathat surely astonished veteran operagoers and newbies alike, for a more impressive array of vocal talent, orchestral excellence and overall production satisfaction would be hard to imagine. It was the most outstanding presentation of the classic that these ears and eyes have heard and seen in a long list that spans the better part of a half century. And it was easily one of the best performances of any opera that the company has presented this century.
Baron Scarpia (Kyle Albertson) plants the seeds of suspicion in Floria Tosca (Ana María Martínez)
From the opening “vivacissimo con violenza” bars of the score, conductorAntony Walkerassured that the orchestra was in top form and at their best, and their playing through the three acts came as near perfection as it gets. Once or twice Walker was compelled to stop his instrumentalists because the audience broke protocol with applause, but this can be overlooked considering how long listeners sat through one thrill after another in silence. Because the vocal talent on stage was so powerful, Walker was able to give the orchestra free rein in the magnificent climaxes. The chorus, underMark Trawka, sang splendidly, as did thePittsburgh Youth Chorus, both groups making the first act a marvel of choral sound, as were the visual grouping and choreography as well.
Mario Cavaradossi (Jonathan Burton) aids escaped political prisoner Cesare Angelotti (Erik Nordstrom)
From the moment Resident ArtistErik Nordstrom, baritone, made his mad dash to center stage with the rise of the curtain, he proved that his debut with the company was a great success. In the time he had the stage to himself, as Cesare Angelotti, the escaped political prisoner – and in later scenes – he gave an ample display of his fine singing and acting abilities. His desperation was palpable; his tones rich, deep and clear. We can look forward to any future appearances Mr. Nordstrom makes with the company.Brian Kontes, well known to local opera audiences, was an ideal Sacristan, both vocally and in his ability to make the most of the role’s brief comic relief.Fran Daniel Laucerica, both vocally and dramatically, was an appropriately creepy Spoletta, and the smaller roles, such as Sciarrone (Matthew Soibelman), the Jailer (J. Patrick McGill) and Roberti (David Bennett), were in capable hands. From behind the scenes,Shannon Crowleysang very sweetly the brief but lovely pipings of the Shepherd Boy.
Baron Scarpia (Kyle Albertson)
TenorJonathan Burtonreturned as Mario Cavaradossi, the painter and political activist. As he has shown previously inRusalkaandIl Trovatore, he possesses a voice that shines robustly and ringingly, and he has great stamina. He seemed a trifle spent toward the third act, but this is pardonable, for his role is long and demanding. In her Pittsburgh Opera debut,Ana Maria Martinezproved that sheisTosca. Garbed as an 1800 fashion plate, she made a striking appearance and gave one of the most sensational vocal performances heard here. Much of the music lies low, but her middle and lower registers are solid and as capable of resounding as resonantly as the role’s highest soprano flights. When she finished the famous “Vissi d’arte” aria in the second act, you could almost feel the audience gasp before it broke into one of the longest ovations heard in years. We can only hope that she comes this way again.
Floria Tosca (Ana María Martínez) comforts the tortured Mario Cavaradossi (Jonathan Burton)
Kyle Albertson’sinterpretation of Baron Scarpia, the villainous chief of police, was virtually the last word on the subject. His baritone voice is so powerful that he could be heard over the full orchestra, chorus, organ and canon blasts that bring the first act to a close. Vocally, dramatically – his performance was one that won’t be forgotten any time soon. He good-naturedly acknowledged the audience’s mixture of thunderous applause and profound boos at the final curtain.
After the first act, the applause was so deafening that the dropped curtain had to be raised again. This was a class act that should be repeated at all performances when warranted. At the climax of Act II, Tosca’s murder of Scarpia is staged much more realistically – meaning violently – than in an ordinary production of this opera. The production team is to be congratulated for creating an excellent background for the massive amount of performing talent; lighting, scenery, costumes are all impressive.

But how can an old institution practicing a European art form that’s been around for 400 years stay relevant in the age of TikTok?

Home›Our Posts›Arts and Ideas›Pittsburgh Opera’s “The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson”
ByGeorge B ParousonApril 29, 2024•(0)
Dramady with Operatic Interludes Opens at the Byham
By George B. Parous
The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson, as is widely known by now, is a play rather than an opera. There certainly is piano-accompanied singing, but about two thirds of the production is eloquently enunciated dialogue. It’s a masterfully crafted play that manages to encapsulate the persona of a remarkable woman into a tight 70 minutes. Much interest has been taken of late into remembering a neglected “local legend” and woman deserving her place in history, but the action is centered on one event that took place in Washington, D. C. Anyone expecting even a mention of Pittsburgh will be disappointed. But this is a good thing.
Sandra Seaton, in crafting her play, wisely chose to focus on one episode in a biographical subject’s life, rather than tackling an attempt to bring Mrs. Dawson’s “life and times” – and all who knew her – into an impossibly long story drawing heavily on psychological drama, a feat attempted by others with little success. She cleverly uses her text, as in Mrs. Dawson’s soliloquy, “I was so eager,” to encapsulate her fierce determination to see a future where others thrive on the fruits of her labors. Mrs. Dawson lived long enough to see the advent of singers such as Leontyne Price and others, though there were still obstacles to overcome. Even a partial list of well-known African American opera singers, present, and in the years following her death, would today make Mary Cardwell Dawson a passionately happy woman.
Mary Cardwell Dawson (Alyson Cambridge)
The basis synopsis of the play, without spoilers, has received publicity, and there were many on hand Saturday evening at the Byham to see and hear how it all played out. Thanks to solid material and much talent, it played very well. Careful attention to the dialogue is an absolute necessity, and one made easy by the cast, since a spot or two has a slight blur between memories and “asides” important to the drama. Quite naturally, sopranoAlyson Cambridgecarries the brunt of the show. Her vocal and dramatic abilities make her a natural for the role, and her performance was much appreciated by the large audience. She positively bubbles over with charm and personality.
Jazmine Olwalia, as Phoebe, the sweet but sassy aspiring Carmen, walked away with her part, providing much of the comedic element and singing with the fine, warm tones we’ve heard grow in volume and confidence over the past two seasons. Her “straight” readings of some of Bizet’s music were impressive, and in the spoken portions of the play she comported herself with as much poise as her character could muster and sent her voice to the farthest corners of the theater. She’s been a valuable part of the Resident Artist Program and it’s unlikely we won’t be seeing and hearing her again in the future.

SopranoMeroë Khalia Adeeb, as Isabelle, has a satiny soprano voice, beautifully timbred, andChristian Mark Gibbs, tenor, as Frank, matched her luscious tones in the portion of the Don José /Micäela duet fromCarmenthey sang. It was the most beautifully sung of the music the play has to offer.

Home›Our Posts›Arts and Ideas›Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘La Traviata’ Another Win For the Company
ByGeorge B ParousonMarch 17, 2024•(1)
Singers, Orchestra, Chorus and Staging as Good as It Gets
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
It was a grand and large audience that heard and saw a spectacular performance of Giuseppe Verdi’sLa Traviatalast evening at the Benedum. The time-worn standard, so popular an opera for over a century and a half, had an especially hostile reception at its première. In the 1850s, it was not uncommon for European audiences to be demonstrative in the extreme. There was jeering because the soprano was large and close to forty, and the tenor fared no better than the orchestra. The day after the première, Verdi wrote to his friend Emanuele Muzio: “La traviatalast night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers’? Time will tell.” Verdi then tweaked the score a bit and it wasn’t long before the opera became the staple it is today.
There was a special sort of energy flowing on both sides of the footlights last evening. The audience was large and definitely in the mood for a night of “grand opera,” and that’s exactly what it got. The performance was “grand” in all departments, from the orchestra, to the singers, to the chorus and all of those behind the scenes, this production may be the best the company has offered this season. Photos can give an idea of the brilliance ofToddNonn’s lighting andPeter Dean Beck’s set designs;Glenn Avery Breed’s magnificent costumes and the choreography designed byAttack Theatre. Everyone included in the artistic team did a fine job and delivered a production better seen than described.

As is usually the case, interest centered to a large degree on the first local performance of a new soprano.Vuvu Mpofu, as Violetta Valéry, gave everything she had to deserve the riotous ovation she received after the final curtain. Her voice is clear and sound throughout the registers, with ringingly silver tops and a secure and warm middle. She possibly was a bit nervous in the first act, since the “È strano! … Ah, fors’ è lui“ scene had spots of uncertainty and a slight disagreement with the orchestra. Nothing else in the long acts to come could stop her. She sang gloriously.
The most astonishing singing of the evening came from baritoneMichael Chioldiin the role of Giorgio Germont. It was his first performance with Pittsburgh Opera, and a marvelous debut it was indeed. I remembered him well from a song recital with Pittsburgh Festival Opera in 2022. He displayed a fine voice then, but nothing could prepare one for the performance he gave last night. A more booming, resonating and powerful voice as Chioldi displayed raised the question of why did we hear him in opera for the first time last evening? His part alone is worth the price of admission.Duke Kim, as Alfredo Germont, also making his first appearance with Pittsburgh Opera, gave another stellar performance. His tenor voice is secure and brilliant, equally placed throughout, and he acted the part as well as he sang. He, too, was clearly an audience favorite.

Julia Swan Lairdgave an excellent demonstration of vocal talent and the art of repose. The part of Annina is frequently listening, and silently observing, and Ms. Laird sang and acted the part in a manner that proved she had the role so clearly wrapped around her thumb that again, and more emphatically, she is a very gifted singing actor.Leah Heater, as Flora Bervoix, was another who made a secondary role stand out in a primary manner. Her warm, strong mezzo-soprano voice is always a pleasure, and she, too, made one wish that the part was larger, just for the joy of hearing her sing.

The cast is rounded out by capable singers in secondary to small parts.Brandon Bell(Baron Douphol),Evan Lazdowski(Marquis d’Obigny),Fran Daniel Laucerica(Gastone de Letorrières),Andrew Bloomgarden(Giuseppe),Oren Gradus(Dr. Grenvil),J. Patrick McGill(Messenger) andJosh Mulkey(Flora’s Servant) all added spirit and color to the remarkable performance. The brilliantly costumed and choreographed chorus gave a mightily vivid account ofMark Trawka’s coaching, and, combined with the supernumeraries, added extra color and liveliness to the scenes.

The long ovation that went toAntony Walkerand the orchestra was a sincere demonstration of appreciation. Together they made the orchestral part of the work symphonic.
This is a grand production in every sense of the word, and the remaining performances deserve audiences like last night’s. For anyone considering a “first opera,” this is the one to see. Old-timers should hear the opera performed in a manner that they’ve probably never heard before. For full production details – and TICKETS – visitPittsburgh Opera.

During the pandemic shutdown, performing-arts groups developed new online programming to try to reach audiences literally where they lived.
But once the shutdown ended, many patrons stayed home. So this week, Pittsburgh Opera is rolling out a new way to physically carry at least some audiences back to theaters — free door-to-door car service.
For the remainder of 2024, the opera will provide Uber vouchers worth $60 each to a limited number of ticket-buyers for each of its Downtown performances. Up to 75 vouchers will be available for each performance on a first-come, first-served basis.
The initiative — the first of its kind in Pittsburgh and perhaps for arts groups anywhere — was announced Monday. The first show to which it will apply is the opera’s new production of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” March 16-24 at the Benedum Center.
“The purpose of this program really is to eliminate barriers to people who want to be able to come to see Pittsburgh Opera performances but are concerned about transportation to get them to the theater,” said spokesperson Chris Cox.
As for many performing-arts groups, attendance at Pittsburgh Opera performances has rebounded from 2021, when large-scale in-person performances resumed, but not to pre-pandemic levels.
Cox said ticket revenue for the troupe’s biggest shows, staged at the Benedum Center, has averaged about 11% less since the fall of 2021 than they averaged in the several seasons before the pandemic.
Cox said both anecdotal feedback from audience members and Pittsburgh Cultural Trust surveys suggest one reason is patrons’ transportation worries.
“Sometimes they don’t feel like driving, they don’t want to worry about having to park somewhere or walking back to the parking lot after the show, and they might not live in an area where public transportation is convenient,” he said.
Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers, which can be used on the show’s performance date for rides starting or ending within a half-mile radius of the theater. There is also a time buffer on either side of the performance to accommodate pre- or post-show activities, he said.
“We believe this is the first program of its kind, both within the region and within the wider opera world,” said Christopher Hahn, the opera’s general director, in a statement.
The program is funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation.
In addition to “La Traviata,” the vouchers will be available for the opera’s three remaining Downtown performances this calendar year, including “The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson," set for April 27-May 5 at the Byham Theater, and its two fall shows at the Benedum, whose titles have yet to be announced.
The offer is not available for shows taking place at the Opera’s Strip District headquarters or other non-Downtown venues.

Home›Our Posts›Review: Pittsburgh Opera Adds ‘Proving Up’ to its List of Season’s Successes
ByGeorge B ParousonFebruary 18, 2024•(0)
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Last eveningPittsburgh Operacontinued their season with the first night ofMissy Mazzoli’s chamber opera,Proving Up. With a libretto byRoyce Vavrek, adapted from a short story by Karen Russell, the 2018 opera has been called “brilliant” byMusical America,and “harrowing… powerful…a true opera of our time” by theWashington Post.  While set in the 1870s, the work is indeed, as theWashington Postsays, an opera of our time.
The music was everything I’ve come to expect from “modern day” opera composers. The “grand opera” idiom is avoided at all cost, as is melody and much in the way of sustained, lyrical passages for the singers. This work is not totally devoid of such things, but they are very much out of the picture.Proving Up, actually, might be the perfect “first opera” for people who think they don’t like opera. This one act production runs approximately 90 minutes, and be on time or you’re not being seated. Likewise, stay in your seat, because if you leave before the performance is over, you’re not getting back in.
As forRoyce Vavrek’s libretto, so much has been discussed in print and previews that much more would be a spoiler for people who like hearing and seeing new operas completely unawares. A link below will provide very detailed information regarding the plot, composer, performers, etc. As may be seen from the photos included, costumes, set designers, lighting, etc., were all entrusted to very capable hands. But angles from the arrangement of seats and other audience members, block much of the far ends of the stage for those seated in at least the third and fourth rows.
Pa Zegner (Brandon Bell) stresses the importance of Miles’ (Fran Daniel Laucerica) upcoming errand
Fran Daniel Laucerica, the gifted singer we’re just getting to know, last evening gave a marvelous display of his vocal and acting abilities in the role of Miles Zegner. He acted in a manner that suited the bleakness that surrounded his character, and sang with a pure and ringing tenor voice that made quite an impression. He exuded a dynamic personality that kept his listeners focused on his characterization, and sang with appealing tones that made an excellent imprint from the start.Opera Newshas deemed him “a very promising high tenor,” and it’s a very fair assessment on the part of the magazine.
Emily Richter, in the rather thankless part of “Ma” Zegner, last evening stirred mixed emotions. She sang, of course, gloriously, her powerful and plush soprano voice filling the studio with its wonted brilliance and warmth, but a touch of pathos must have been felt by many in the audience. These are the last performances she will give as a Resident Artist with Pittsburgh Opera.  From here she moves on to the Ryan Opera Center at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and other promising opportunities. We have not heard the last of her; that she won’t be engaged by Pittsburgh Opera for future productions is unfathomable.  Until that time, one of the greatest of vocal artists who have come this way will be very much missed, indeed.
Pa, Ma, and Peter Zegner ((Emily Richter, Brandon Bell, Mason Dowd) wish Miles (Fran Daniel Laucerica) a successful journey
Evan Lazdowski, while having  shown his bass voice most favorably in past productions, last night was a revelation. He sang with a true mastery ofbel cantophrasing and fluidity, qualities sometimes missing in singers of his range. The creepy Sodbuster is a role that suits his cavernous, lustrous bass voice perfectly, and he sang with a booming resonance that topped all of the fine performances he has given to date, which is saying much.  The deep and golden tones ofBrandon Bell, as “Pa” Zegner, were on full display and at their best, as well, and he acted the role with the same attention to detail that he also applies to his singing.
(Left to right) Peter Zegner (Mason Dowd), Littler Zegner Sister (Jazmine Olwalia), Taller Zegner Sister (Julia Swan Laird), Mrs. Johannes (Ma Zegner, Emily Richter), Mr. Johannes (Pa Zegner, Brandon Bell)
Julia Swan LairdandJazmine Olwalia, familiar faces and voices also nearing the end of their runs as Resident Artists with Pittsburgh Opera, rounded out the well chosen cast, as didMason Dowdas Peter. The two “sisters,” Laird and Olwalia, did an excellent job of giving their listeners increasingly larger doses of the heebie-jeebies as the opera progressed.
From on high,James Lesniakand the reduced orchestra gave support and a fine performance of their own, the violins and harps augmented by an occasional harmonica or two. Mazzoli’s orchestration is very clever in the use of the twenty or so players to get across moods and themes of the libretto. Strings sometimes sound like fiddles being sawed – everything from a hoedown to utter bleakness is painted in the score, and Lesniak and his players, high above the stage, did noble work sending these jagged rhythms and occasional chaos out over the singers below.
The Sodbuster (Evan Lazdowski, with Zegner sisters Julia Swan Laird and Jazmine Olwalia) brings bad news and an aura of menace
The audience was a diversified one of all ages that occupied most of the studio’s limited seating. The singers, orchestra and production staff got hearty rounds of applause, and hopefully this will be a trend for the remaining performances.

ByGeorge B ParousonFebruary 11, 2024•(0)
Resident Artist Tenor Speaks of Upcoming Production
Next Saturday, February 17, 2024, marks the first production byPittsburgh Operaof Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek’sProving Up, a work which has been called “Harrowing…powerful… a true opera of our time” byThe Washington Postand “A tense and creepy journey into the heart of Manifest Destiny’s darkness” byThe New York Times. TenorFran Daniel Laucerica, who will sing a leading role in the production, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and his career to date toChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera. We’re pleased that the company has shared the interview with us, exclusively, as below:
Chris Cox: Fran Daniel Laucerica, tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you end up at Pittsburgh Opera as a Resident Artist?
Fran Daniel Laucerica: I’m originally from Miami, Florida. I’ve always known and heard a lot of great things about Pittsburgh Opera. It was funny, I happened to be in town for some coachings with [Pittsburgh Opera Director of Musical Studies and Chorus Master]Mark Trawkaand [Pittsburgh Opera Music Director]Antony Walkerbecause I had a couple auditions coming up in Europe, when they learned that their tenor from last season, Daniel O’Hearn, wasn’t returning.
So, while I was in town, they both asked me, “Oh, do you have anything going on next season?”, and I said, “Well, nothing on the books yet apart from some individual gigs lined up.” And so eventually I got an email from [Pittsburgh Opera Director of Artistic Operations]Rob Boldinin the middle of the summer that said, “Hey, any interest?” And I said, “Definitely.” I immediately accepted it.
Chris Cox:What have some of the highlights been for you in your first half of the season so far?
Fran Daniel Laucerica:Definitely singing the role of Count Almaviva inThe Barber of Sevillestudent matinee. That was a role that I’ve almost sung about three times, so it was nice to finally do it. I had never done a student matinee before, and the energy from that audience was unreal. I’ve never felt more like a rock star.
I also really enjoyed learning a lot of new repertoire for the community concerts, in Market Square and small events, and for our Song Shop concerts. That’s been a lot of fun. Most recently, theFellow Travelersscene thatBrandon Belland I did for the “Valentine’s Day” Song Shop was really exciting. It’s a role that I’ve covered before, but that was a scene that I’ve never performed, even though I’ve sung some things from it in concert.
Certainly,Iphigéniewas great. My role in that, Pylade, is actually a role that my grad school teacher said, “Oh, you should look at this aria,” and it was so hard for me back then. It definitely felt like a huge victory to find a good place in it, and I feel like I found more of my rhythm in it with each performance. Character-wise it was so fulfilling, Pylade is such an interesting character.
ButProving Upis my biggest role on stage for the season. I’m really excited about the piece, and I loveMissyMazzoli‘s music.
Chris Cox:Speaking ofProving Up, tell us a little bit about your character, Miles Zegner.
The Zegners – Miles (Fran Daniel Laucerica, in front), Pa (Brandon Bell) and Ma (Emily Richter)
Fran Daniel Laucerica:Well, he’s a 13-year-old kid who was born on the East Coast, and is the youngest in his family. He was very little when they moved to Nebraska, where the story takes place. He has all of the optimism that his parents had when they initially moved to Nebraska, without any of the jadedness and the souring that happened to them over time. He’s excited to grow up and be a man and prove himself to his father, and for his family to prove themselves as a name. He’s really hopeful in comparison to the rest of the characters. Earnest is the way I would describe him because there’s no double-sidedness to any of his enthusiasm.
Chris Cox:Is there any difference in how you prepare for, or sing, a role like this in a modern opera versus a ‘classic’ opera from hundreds of years ago likeThe Barber of Seville?
Fran Daniel Laucerica:The preparation is similar. You translate your text. In this case it’s in English, so I don’t have to translate. But pretty much everything else is the same – coachings, studying, looking at the libretto, looking at any sort of original sources, watch it if you can, listen to it if you can.
Chris Cox:What are some of the things that the audience has to look forward to in this show?
Fran Daniel Laucerica:It’s a very interesting story, a very inherently American story. Even if you aren’t aware of this point in history and the specific Homestead Act, you know the big “lift yourself up by your bootstraps” type of idea in this country. You feel a weight, culturally, when you’re listening to this music and you’re hearing the story.
And frankly, it’s always nice to hear opera in our own language. It’s always nice to hear an updated and yet still accessible musical language, which I think Missy does a really good job of in this piece. I think that the roles really suit everybody in the case quite well, pretty amazingly. You’re going to hear each role sung at a very high level.
Chris Cox:Most of the audience members presumably did not grow up in 1870s Nebraska, so what are some of the things about the show that they will relate to and identify with?
Fran Daniel Laucerica:The overarching thing that we can relate to is wanting more, and never really being satisfied with the things that we already do have. There’s also the aspect of familial relationships, and the fact that children grow up constantly seeking approval from their parents. Also you see the trajectory of people becoming a little bit hardened through time and hardship, and how that affects and trickles down to their children.
So there’s a lot we can relate to, even though we may not be farmers in the Midwest in the 1870s.
Chris Cox:What else is compelling about this production?
Fran Daniel Laucerica:The actual conception of the production is really interesting. Stage DirectorHaley Stamatshas done a great job of directing this in a way that’s completely her own and gives everything a certain amount of weight. Everything that you see on stage alludes to something else. So even though you’re looking at a doorway, it’s not really quite just a doorway. Even if you’re looking at a window, it’s not just a window. Her direction has been really, really helpful in finding gravitas and what we call high stakes in acting.
The set itself is magnificent. The audience is on both sides of us. That’s something that doesn’t happen very often in opera, and it makes the performances very intimate – the audience will really feel they’re a part of the story along with us.

Company Shares Exclusive Interview with Soprano Emily Richter, Who Will Appear in the Title Role
SopranoEmily Richter, who will sing the title role inPittsburgh Opera’sproduction ofIphigénie en Tauridebeginning this Saturday evening, January 20, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and her career to date toChris Cox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera. As Ms. Richter has done a great deal of genuinely excellent singing in her time with the company, much interest may be taken in her comments and observations.
Chris Cox: Emily Richter, please tell the audience a little bit about yourself.
Emily Richter: Thank you for having me. I’m a second year Resident Artist here at Pittsburgh Opera. I’m from Arlington, Virginia, but I’m a foreign service kid, so I grew up moving around a lot, mostly overseas.
Chris Cox: Where are some of the places you lived abroad growing up?
Emily Richter: Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Armenia, Geneva, DC, London. And while I was in college, my family was in Tokyo.
Chris Cox: Did you have a favorite place?
Emily Richter:   It’s always hard to say, because how do you compare being 8 years old to being 18? But when I was in London, it was a really formative time for me, not just in my life, but also musically. I was really involved with the National Youth Choir, and the London Youth Choir. I sang at the Royal Albert Hall, and with the Royal Philharmonic Chorus. I had really, really amazing musical experiences, and that was where I said to myself, “okay, I want to do this – I want to sing.”
Chris Cox:  Is that how you got into opera?
Emily Richter:   I grew up playing piano, doing choir, and just loving music, so I knew I wanted to do music as a career from a very young age. Once I got to college I became a Classical Voice major. That’s when I really committed to singing and classical music. When you’re doing a degree in Classical Voice, that means that you are doing operas. I saw that opera was a combination of really interesting, rich music and singing, which I love, and theater, which I love, and languages, and history, and literature, and just all sorts of things that I loved to do.
Chris Cox:  Besides your work for Pittsburgh Opera this season, you’ve had other exciting experiences recently and have been in some competitions.
Emily Richter: Yes, it’s been a very exciting season. I got to do myMessiahdebut with Seattle Symphony, and [Pittsburgh Opera Music Director]Anthony Walkerwas the conductor.
And then for competitions, I won the Mildred Miller competition here in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Mildred passed away this year. I was able to sing at her funeral and honor her. That competition is such a big part of her legacy, so it was an especially important year to have received that honor.
I also won the Districts at the Met Opera Competition, and qualified for Regionals, which take place the same day as opening night ofIphigénie.
Chris Cox: Goodness gracious. Where are the Regionals?
Emily Richter: They’re here in Pittsburgh, at Kresge Theater at Carnegie Mellon.
Chris Cox:  So you don’t have to get in a car and drive from Buffalo and pray there’s no traffic to get toIphigénieon time.
Emily Richter: Exactly. They’re local, so it’s low maintenance that way, but high maintenance in that it’s a big day of singing.
Chris Cox: I’ll say. Sleep in on Sunday for sure.
Emily Richter: I have lot of people coming into town, so I’ll be getting up for breakfast, but it’ll be worth it.
Chris Cox: That’s exciting. Talking aboutIphigénie, you mentioned history and literature are interests of yours, so this production should be right up your alley.
Emily Richter: This is a really cool one because I haven’t dabbled much with Greek mythology. There’s a lot of backstory to this piece before we even meet Iphigénie. What happened to Iphigénie is that her father Agamemnon was getting ready for the Trojan War. His fleet wasn’t getting any wind, so they couldn’t sail off to Troy. This was going on for months, and he was given the counsel that the only way to get the winds to blow would be to sacrifice his daughter to the gods. So Agamemnon tells Iphigénie that she’s going to marry Achilles, and she shows up and he slaughters her over the altar.
But in our story, right before she’s slaughtered, she’s plucked up by the goddess Artemis, or in our case, Diana, and put onto this island, Tauride, to be a priestess.
Chris Cox: So now she’s in Tauride, as a priestess, and she’s tasked with killing people. How does she feel about that, and how do you translate her feelings onto the stage?
Emily Richter: This show, and her character specifically, shows a lot of moral conflict. As you said, she’s placed on that island to perform human sacrifices as high priestess to anybody who enters that island. She’s sort of a political prisoner because she’s not really empowered – she’s very much under the will of King Thoas. But she also is ordained by this goddess who saved her life to complete this task. And from the beginning it’s very clear, it doesn’t feel right to her. She doesn’t enjoy it, but she doesn’t feel like she has free will. And so what we see throughout the show is this moral conflict leading her to exercise her free will. And it’s mostly because she sees this man who is her brother, but she doesn’t know it’s her brother. She’s drawn to him and she doesn’t understand why because she doesn’t know who he is. Her connection to him is the thing that propels her towards free will.
Chris Cox: Musically, what does the audience have in store for them?
Emily Richter: This is such an interesting piece musically. It’s by Gluck, who was composing just before Mozart. He and Mozart were alive at the same time, but this piece came out right before Mozart was really in his prime. What’s interesting about it musically is it feels so far ahead of its time. He looked around and he said, “All these de capo arias, how are they serving the plot?” He really innovated, for lack of a better word, the structure of operas. Everything is through-composed, everything is dramatically driven. He’s so far ahead of his time, you would think that this was an opera composed a hundred years later. But it also has some elements of Baroque style in it. It’s really beautiful and unique and kind of groundbreaking musically. I’m excited for the audience to hear that.
Chris Cox: How are the rehearsals going?
Emily Richter: What’s great here is that have a core ensemble that’s been working together for two years. We all know each other super well. That’s a luxury that you just don’t get very often in opera. You’re usually locked into a place for two weeks and you have to make beautiful art with people that you don’t know as well. But here we really understand how to collaborate together, which makes for a really rewarding process.
Chris Cox: What are you most looking forward to about this production?
Emily Richter:  The music pulls things out of you which you would never expect. It’s very spacious, and I really enjoy singing it. You learn something new every time you do. I’m excited to share this music with everyone.
Chris Cox: After this season is over and you’ve completed your Pittsburgh Opera residency, what will you be doing next?
Emily Richter: Directly from my residency in Pittsburgh, I’m moving on to another residency, at the Lyric Opera of Chicago with their Ryan Opera Center Ensemble. I’m super excited and I couldn’t have done it without the launching pad that I’ve had at Pittsburgh Opera.
Chris Cox:  But first we haveIphigénie. Why should a potential ticket buyer come and see this show?
Emily Richter:  We have human sacrifice, and Greek mythology, and high drama and crazy music, and there’s brotherhood, there’s war, lots of battle scenes. We have this amazing fight choreography team that’s been with us that does amazing work. There’s lots of sword fighting and big epic battles. It is an exciting, thrilling, high drama with a lot packed into it – all set  to beautiful music!

The Briney Sea Tale of ‘The Flying Dutchman’ Appears to Be All That Pittsburgh Audiences Will Hear of Richard Wagner; the Gloom of the ‘Dutchman’ For the First Time in Two Decades
By George B. Parous
Last evening,Pittsburgh Operagave its first performance of aRichard Wagnermusic-drama in twenty years. The work was, of course,Der fliegende Holländer, and it was an excellent performance indeed. But why notTannhäuser? Lohengrin?Maybe one of the better known, stand alone “Ring” music-dramas, such asDie Walküre? Never heard locally in years and sure to pull in Wagnerian devotees from the tri-state area and/or beyond, any of these masterpieces, given with the right cast, conductor and director, notwithstanding financial and managerial trepidation, would thrill, and the novelty of any of Wagner’s works would test the Benedum’s seating capacity for all four performances. Or maybe cut the number of performances to three, making it easier for all, including the singers, orchestra and management. Instead, after large gaps in time, we’re thrownThe Flying Dutchman, a work which certainly has its beauties, but as a demonstration of Wagner’s genius is far – very far – from his best. But it’s comparatively short, for Wagner, and people can get to the garages before their carriages return to pumpkins, so it’s the “Dutchman” we get, or nothing.
The Dutchman (Kyle Albertson)
The mob on hand last night proved the point that Wagner can draw an audience. Whether the performances remaining in the run will do the same remains to be seen. The production is loaded with vocal talent and has a first-class orchestra and dynamic conductor to swell or sing softly from below, never drowning the singers, but remaining a vividly pronounced part of the performance, as Wagner intended. From the opening page of the music-drama’s inspired overture, it was plain thatAntony Walkerand the orchestra had put a great deal of time into perfecting their interpretation of the magnificent score. From the most thunderous passages to the most haunting, tenderest of pianissimos, Walker kept the instrumentalists in the foreground, while the singers had the voices quite capable of riding the waves of majestic sound. Much the same may be said of the large chorus thatMark Trawkacoached. It was a remarkable demonstration of ensemble singing, predominately male, as is frequently the case with Wagner, but equally impressive when the sopranos and mezzos dominated – beautifully – the opening of the second act. The large group of singers and supes were a joy for the ear and eye, but in spots seemed awkwardly placed in action and repose, possibly due to the design of the set.
That aspect is left largely to the imagination, as is usually the case with Wagner stagings here and abroad for the last eighty years or so. Projections serve as ships, doors in walls where doors shouldn’t be serve as exits/entrances, while the doomed lovers’ denouement comes almost as an anti-climax. But things could have been worse and frequently are, even at the Metropolitan Opera and at the famous Bayreuth Festivals devoted to Wagner’s music-dramas, where a notorious production, for instance, had the chorus ofLohengrinin white mice costumes. In this and others, crowds cheer the singers and vigorously boo the production personnel brave enough to appear on stage, but nothing changes. Following Wagner’s stage directions to the letter can be expensive, but it can be done, and if numerous critics can be believed, there was a time when it was, and anything less was called out. From Wagner’s lifetime until about World War II, brilliant ideas for set designs and directions are described in meticulous detail. And this has nothing to do with romanticizing a “golden age” of opera long gone, for the period most frequently referred to as “golden” never existed, as far as opera itself is concerned. There were (and are) periods in musical history and the present when unusually large groups of especially gifted singers and conductors bolster the box-office. It was only in the days prior to mass media when golden ages of the operasingerscame and went, while critics, even in those ages, took exception to the makeshifts as described above. One needs only to put aside single-source books on the “Golden Age,” and spend time researching daily newspaper archives, to make the romanticized walls tumble. There are amazing opera singers in profusion today. Their every glamorous movement, however, doesn’t “make the papers,” as they did once upon a time.
Erik (Bryan Register) is upset that Senta’s (Marjorie Owens) mind is elsewhere (photographed at the Benedum Center in downtown Pittsburgh at the final dress rehearsal on November 9th)
Senta jumped ship before the curtain went up last evening. Soprano Marjorie Owens, long announced for the soprano role of Senta, was indisposed, andAlexandria Shinertook her place at the last possible moment. Ms. Shiner disappointed no one, as she has an exceptionally large, ringing “Wagnerian” voice, at its best and most evenly produced in forte passages. There were brief moments of uncertainty that can hardly be held against her, considering the fact that she was saving the day at the last minute, with very limited preparation time. Her voice is lustrous, and should Ms. Owens recover before the end of the run (which is expected), those who missed Ms. Shiner missed a real treat.UPDATE:It was, indeed, the soprano’s first time singing the role of Senta on any stage.
Steuermann (Daniel O’Hearn) keeps watch for Daland (Peter Volpe)
Bass-baritoneKyle Albertson, in his Pittsburgh Opera debut, made a colossal first impression. Commanding in presence and gifted with a voice that fits the role of the Dutchman like a glove, his wide range allows for effortless high tones, as well as powerful, resonant, clear and cavernous lows that ring out with apparent ease to the eye and a thrill to the ear. It took no effort whatsoever to imagine why Senta would be willing to sacrifice everything for this Dutchman, and it was easy to imagine a line behind her in the last moments of the music drama. BassPeter Volpe, in the role of Daland, sang out with a powerfully robust voice as well, and in action allowed for the few moments of levity to be found in the otherwise gloomy text.
TenorBryan Register, in the part of Erik, strengthened the marvelous ensemble with his powerfully ringing voice, and vivid conception of the role. The man’s resume includes Wagner’s Tristan, and he lifted a usually secondary role to the level of the ensemble with his warm and virile tones.Leah Heaterwas good to hear again, and she made much of the small role of Mary. The part is one that is easily lost to the background, but her strong, sweet mezzo-soprano voice and charming stage presence brought the full potential of the role to rare prominence. Much the same may be said of tenorDaniel O’Hearn, in the role of the Steersman. Memory doesn’t recall a tenor who made as much of an impression in the part; one who made the role’s presence and songs anything other than uninteresting. Both singing actors are to be congratulated for what they bring to the production.
Mary (Leah Heater)
Altogether, and as it should be, the production meets Wagner’s fervent desire for a finely blended ensemble. Every singer, the chorus, the supes and the orchestra were united in making the performance “the thing,” and even those in the audience who were brand new to Wagner, from bits overheard in the foyers, took notice that what they just saw and heard was something totally different, totally new, from anything they’d ever before heard and seen in an opera performance. And they were absolutely right.
This is a production not to be missed. Remaining performances are on November 14th, 17th, and  19th. Tickets can be had at the box-office or ordered online atPittsburgh Opera.

The villagers, overshadowed by the Dutchman’s ship in port, assemble to celebrate a faithful marriage.
To understand one of the many merits Richard Wagner earned in his career as a composer of more than a dozen operas, a simplistic snapshot of the history of theater helps distinguish his early work.The Flying DutchmanorDer Fliegende Hollander, Pittsburgh Opera’s current offering at the Benedum Center, was last performed in Pittsburgh 20 years ago. At least, compared to other great operatic stories, there may have been a reason for the long wait. It’s not easy to recreate a masted ghost ship to dock on stage. But that reason has nothing to do with Wagner’s sweeping musical composition which elegantly, powerfully and dramatically places his audience on a precipice overlooking the raging Nordic Sea.
By 1800, albeit born from French Theater, the ideal dramatic plot had transformed from melodrama to the “well-made play.” The story of a melodrama unravels when a hero is cheated by a villain who in turn is defeated (or vanquished) with love (or valor) always stronger than treachery. It’s every plot that Jeanette McDonald and Nelson Eddy sang in their early “talkies” or that Dudley Do-Right, sweetheart Nell, and Snidely Whiplash clown around in more modern cartoons. The “well-made play” improved that formula. Still, there was a good guy and a bad guy, and at least one love interest, but added to the plot was a higher power––or a powerful secret––of which only the audience was made aware. Otherwise known as “dramatic irony,” the “well-made play” included this engaging pretense that the audience was smarter than either the hero or the villain. When a god would descend to end the conflict—or the missing letter was revealed to prove the truth––the story concluded with a major climax. Wagner’s idea for his tale about a lovesick captain doomed to sail the seven seas until he finds a faithful bride straddles these dramatic story structures. It’s pure melodrama but with a surprising climax.
Symphony and The Sea
Kyle Albertson as The Flying Dutchman finds land and hope.
But that’s not why “The Dutchman,” one of Wagner’s earliest works, is still performed by premiere opera companies around the world. Just listening to his overture, a good ten minutes ofleitmotifs(literally, leading themes which will be reprised later) beckons, begs, and wholly captures audience expectation. Here, well before the curtain rises, we hear the sea, we experience a storm approaching, we jump when thunderous waves crash ashore, we calm our souls as the clouds roll past, and we awaken to the human struggle of survival, love and honor. Wagner’s incredible “translation” of the sea has been mimicked, “covered,” and copied in countless seafaring film scores for decades. His overture alone is worth the price of admission.
By which effect, let us return to explore Wagner’s merits. He approached opera as a composer-conductor influenced heavily by Mozart, who famously wrote opera, and Beethoven, who wrote but one. Wagner believed that opera should aspire to greater heights by incorporating all elements of dramatic theater. By Wagner’s own termgesamtkunstwerk, he meant to create total works of art, balancing the contributions of his musical composition with character, action, conflict, catharsis—even with costumes and spectacular stagecraft––to achieve something greater than the sum of its parts. That said, however, none of Wagner’s works are appreciated more than for his powerful music. And that is decidedly so in this current production.
Debuts and Dedication
Peter Volpe, as Daland, and his Steersman, performed by Daniel O’Hearn, search for safer shores.
Mind you, Pittsburgh Opera’s talent is outstanding. Leading the cast as well as the story line is Captain Daland, performed by Peter Volpe, projecting the demanding role with an astounding vocal range, both baritone and bass, at one point hitting a note seemingly subterranean. He can act, too. Volpe is not shy in expressing his character’s dark moods or lofty ambition, in fact, in one scene he elicits a laugh or two for his appropriate antics. Daniel O’Hearn who performs the role of Steuermann, the ship’ssteersman, is also remarkable. His rich tenor calms thesea, as well as his captain, to set the scene for the dramatic entrance of the famous Dutchman, both handsome and imposing. Performed by Kyle Albertson, looking every bit the part, the title character asserts his interest in meeting Daland’s daughter, Senta. Debuting in Pittsburgh with this production, Albertson is a Wagnerian artist through and through, having performed the composer’s many works in five seasons at the Met. And were it not for a last-minute health issue, the role of Senta might have been sung by Marjorie Owens, also to have debuted in Pittsburgh. Rather, flying in from Cape Town, South Africa, where she’d just finished competing in the 2023 Operalia competition, Alexandria Shiner commanded the stage, beginning rehearsals only three days before her debut. Quite evidently, Ms. Shiner is intimately familiar with Wagner’s works, and particularly this pivotal role. A strong soprano, she shattered audience expectations (the audience was informed of the last-minute substitution just prior to the overture) with the vocal agility the role demands.
Erik, performed by Bryan Register, seeks the attention of Senta, played by Marjorie Owens (in rehearsal).
In the supporting roles of Mary, nurse to Senta, and Erik, Senta’s erstwhile love interest, are Leah Heater and Bryan Register. A fine mezzo-soprano, Heater is a resident alumna of the Pittsburgh Opera who will return to perform Flora this spring in La Traviata. Also debuting in Pittsburgh, Register is a highly accomplished tenor who will undertake leading roles elsewhere this season in two more Wagner works, specifically,Parsifalin Spain andTristan und Isoldein Germany. A cast of maidens, spinning their fishing nets, Daland’s crew, attending to his storm ravaged ship, and the Dutchman’s ghostly sailors, lamenting their seafaring woes, are too many to list, but laudable credit is due their fine harmony and vocal support.
Without revealing the climax, the tale of this ancient legend is resolved with unexpected drama. The scene alone may have set Wagner’s early work as something quite innovative for its time. Suffice it to suggest that a bride’s commitment to remaining faithful may be both sweet and short.
The Dutchman and Senta consummate their bonds.
Faith and Fidelity
Yet, if Wagner intended to create opera in which all the elements of good theater combine to support a single great work of art, this production falters in several distracting ways. There can be no fault if a director sets this ancient tale in more modern times, but some things seem out of kilter.
First off, to allay the expense of building a ghost ship (or at least part of one) on stage, this production employs modern technology. (Wagner, of course, would be amazed; so might an opera director just twenty years ago.) The set, constructed with appropriately Nordic-style batten walls, informs us with video projections that are sweeping and brilliant, but a bit confusing. Captain Daland’s ship is a modern, industrial tanker while the dutchman sails an ancient galleon with “black masts and blood red sails.” At best, the incongruity of scale is spooky. The Flying Dutchman, a legendary figure as old as time, banished by Satan to sail the seven seas, is idolized by Senta who stares and pines over his framed portrait hung prominently on a wall. But… is that aphotograph?Likewise, when the village gathers for a picnic, any old crate, tub, or barrel would appear less jarring than red and blue Playmate-brand plastic coolers.
Bravos are nonetheless due the masterful orchestra and its conductor, Antony Walker, as well as the stage director, Sam Helfrich, and set designer, Steven C. Kemp. The visual projections were designed by Ian Wallace and costumes by Nancy Leary. Cindy Knight is the stage manager. Projection design is by Ian Wallace, lighting designer is Derek Van Heel, and James Geier is wig and makeup designer.
No matter the visual clues that help define this legendary tale, whether modern or classic,The Flying Dutchmanis timeless. Kudos to the Pittsburgh Opera for bringing it back to life after a long absence.
Tickets forThe Flying Dutchmanare available at very reasonable prices for performances now through November 19 at thePittsburgh Opera. Benedum Center, 237 7th Ave., Cultural District.
Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘The Flying Dutchman’ is a haunting love story with a dramatic score from Wagner.

Home›Our Posts›Arts and Ideas›Pittsburgh Opera Offers Exclusive Interview with Bryan Register
ByGeorge B ParousonNovember 7, 2023•(0)
Tenor to Make His Local Debut Singing ‘Erik’ in Upcoming“The Flying Dutchman”Performances
TenorBryan Register, who will sing the role of Erik inPittsburgh Opera’s production ofDer fliegende Holländer, beginning this Saturday evening, November 11, took the time recently to give an exclusive interview regarding the production and his career – a career which began with the lateBirgit Nilssonfunding his education.ChrisCox, Director of Marketing and Communications for Pittsburgh Opera, provided the interview, as follows:
Chris Cox: “Thanks for joining me today, Bryan. I’ll start by asking, how did you first get interested in opera?”
Bryan Register: “The first time that I was exposed to opera was when I was in third grade. A troupe from Opera Carolina came to my elementary school. They did scenes from the opera that they were doing. And they did a mock opera with some of the students. We dressed in costumes that we brought from home. They did a fake stage, and staged a couple of scenes where they told us what the story was, and we were supposed to act out the scenes. The local newspaper was there taking pictures and put an article in the paper. I’ve got that picture of me from third grade doing the opera scene. That’s my operatic debut if you want to call it that.
“I can still remember how excited I was, and the feeling that I got when I heard the singers singing. It was so new, and there was something magical about it. And it was something that really attracted me. I didn’t know at that time that I really wanted to be an opera singer per se, because I was studying piano. But it was an aspect of music that I had not been exposed to before that I thought was fascinating.
“It reinforces how important outreach is, because you never know when you’re going to affect somebody’s life. That doesn’t mean that they have to end up being an opera singer, but it could spark something in their imagination that would take them off into some other creative field, or they would want to be involved with the opera in some administrative capacity.”
CC: “When did you start training as an opera singer?”
BR: “My undergrad was at Morehead State University in Kentucky. My parents wanted me to get an education degree. I wanted to go for a performance degree. I had studied piano all my life, and I wanted to go into piano performance. And that’s what I thought I wanted to do. I thought I wanted to concertize as a pianist and do chamber music. That was a dream for me. If I could just travel around the world playing chamber music and giving recitals, that would be a dream job.
“My dad did not want me to be a music major. He thought it was too risky, and that I would not have a firm financial net if that didn’t work out. So after many, many nights of discussions, he finally convinced me that I should be a music education major. And he said, ‘We’ll find the right teacher who’s going to challenge you with your piano, and you’ll get the best of both worlds.’ So I agreed. Morehead had a really good reputation for music education, and I went there.
“All the music majors had to appear one week before class started so that we could take placement exams for music reading, music history, sight-singing, etc.  I appeared for my sight-reading exam. I walked into a studio. There was one of the voice teachers, and she had a music stand up. On the music stand was a handwritten melody on manuscript paper. She said, ‘Would you please sing this for me? I’ll give you the first pitch.’ So she did, and I sang something which I can only imagine was a mess.
“She said, ‘Okay. Can you sing that again, and conduct yourself while you’re doing it?’ And I said, ‘Okay.’ We did it again. And she was looking at me funny, and she said, ‘Okay. I’m going to play the piano. Do you know the national anthem?’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ She said, ‘I want you to sing the national anthem, and I’m going to play the piano.’ So here we go. We got about halfway through the national anthem, and she stopped and she was looking at me really funny. And she said, ‘You’re a piano major?’ When I said yes, she said ‘Hold on.’
“She got on the phone and called her husband. He was the chair of the voice department. And she said, ‘Jim, can you come up and listen to this?’ So he came up. She said, ‘Bryan, sing this again. I’m going to play the national anthem. You sing.’ I started singing the national anthem, got about halfway through, and he stopped me. He said, ‘Young man, you need to change your major.’ And I said, ‘What?’ He said, ‘You should be a voice major. You have a professional instrument, and you should be a voice major. I’m going to speak to your piano teacher,’ who was also my academic advisor.
“I thought he was crazy. I said, ‘Mr. Beane, I really appreciate the vote of confidence. I’m flattered, but I’ve studied piano my entire life, and I am not comfortable with just throwing that all out the window just because you like the way I sing the national anthem. I can’t even wrap my head around that.’ And I left.
“The next day, my piano teacher called me into her studio, and she said, ‘Bryan, I’ve worked with James Beane for the last 35 years, and I have never seen him behave like this.’ She said. ‘He came into my room, flushed red in the face, told me that he had just heard a tenor that has a major professional instrument, and he says he’s a piano major but he should be studying voice. And he’s insisting that you change to a voice major.’
“I stood there in complete shock. She said, ‘I want to be very clear. I’m not saying that you have to change your major. I’m very happy for you to be a piano major. I know how you play. We can do great work. That’s not what I’m talking about.’ She said, ‘I’m just relaying to you what I experienced.’ And she said, ‘I have to tell you what he said.’ ‘Well, he basically told me the same thing yesterday, and I was really surprised by it. And I told him no. I wanted to be a piano major.’ And she said, ‘Well, fine. I can say that we’ve had a meeting. I will tell him your decision, and we’ll consider it done.”
“The next day, I got another call. I went back to her studio. She said, ‘I told him what you said, and he doesn’t accept that answer. He said that he insists that you take voice lessons, and we have to find out a way to do it.’ And then Mrs. Stetler, my piano teacher, she said, ‘I actually have a suggestion that might work.’ She said, ‘Since I am your academic advisor, you have two-hour credits for electives every year.’ She said, ‘I’ve already spoken to him, and a two-hour credit would not cover the private lessons.’ But she said, ‘He said that he would be willing to accept it, and he would give you lessons on his day off because his studio is full.'”
“I said, ‘Really? He’s going to teach me for cheap, and on his day off?’ She said, ‘Yes. I think you should do it, Bryan, because pianists learn from singers. You’re going to learn so much about phrasing and musicality and breath, which you still need as a good pianist.’ And she said, ‘You’re also going to learn the literature.’ She said, ‘If you’re going to be a pianist and you are interested in chamber music, there will come a time in your life when you’re going to be playing for singers, and you need to have experience doing that. I suggest you take voice lessons as an elective, and you volunteer to play for his voice students in his studio for private lessons. Then I’ll sign off on your electives, and you can eliminate a math or science class, and you’ll be doing this instead.’
“I said, ‘Fine. I’m there. Let’s do it.’ So after about two years of that, I realized, ‘Oh my God, I think he might be right,’ because my voice started growing, and I could sense a change. I could tell that the technique was starting to work. I could hear and feel a change. And it was also really fun. It was an immediate connection with the expression that I didn’t have with my piano playing. And it also included foreign languages. I love foreign languages. I loved acting. I loved the drama side of things. It almost pulled everything into one piece that was really attractive to me.
“So by the time I graduated, I was faced with a dilemma. Do I continue with piano, or do I go for voice? And I decided that I was going to get my master’s in vocal performance. I got a full ride at Manhattan School of Music. When I got to New York, at the end of my time there, the dean called me to his office, told me that Birgit Nilsson had paid for my school, and I had to write her a thank-you note. And I almost had a heart attack. I could not believe it.
“And he told me the story about how that happened, that she came for a masterclass on the day of the auditions. They videotaped all of the auditions. And the faculty was reviewing the videotapes to recommend if the person should have scholarship or not, and everybody was arguing. There was actually an argument in the faculty about what is my voice, because it was unusual, and people didn’t know exactly what to do and what to think. And so they called Birgit Nilsson in to listen, and they wanted to know her opinion. And she said, “Oh, well, he’s a heldentenor. That’s a baby heldentenor. And I think he’s going to be quite a good one, if my instincts are right.” And that’s when she said, “I want to pay for his education.” She paid for everything. So I consider Birgit Nilsson to be my fairy godmother.”
CC:“Did you ever get a chance to meet her in person afterwards?”
BR:“No, I never got a chance to meet her. I wrote her a letter. She wrote me back.  But by that time, she had retired. She died before I had a major gig in Europe that she could come to.”
CC:“That’s an absolutely amazing story.”
BR:“It still shocks me when I tell the story, when I think about it. It still absolutely shocks me.”
CC:“You sing much more in Europe than you do in the United States. How did that come about? How often do you get back to the United States?”
BR:“I definitely sing more in Europe than I do in the States. The last time I sang in the States was 2010, 2012, something like that. It’s been a long time.”
CC:“This is your first time singing in the United States in a decade?”
BR:“Yes. And here I am at Pittsburgh.”
CC:“Welcome back.”
BR:“Thank you. I was accepted into the Wagner Society of Washington, DC, which had a training program. It was run by Evelyn Lear and Thomas Stewart. After doing two years of that, I did some auditions in Germany that was part of the training program. They paid for our German lessons at Deutsches Haus in New York. They paid for our coachings. They flew us over to Germany to do auditions. It was really a fantastic program.
“I won second place in the Liederkranz Vocal Competition in New York, Wagner Division. And the prize for that was $10,000 in cash and an audition at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen and at Covent Garden. So I had flown over to Copenhagen to audition, and then I flew over to London to audition. At my audition in London was the head of the vocal division for Intermusica, a big agency in London, and a casting director for English National Opera. I walked out of there with European management and two contracts at ENO.
CC:“That’s a productive trip.”
BR:“Yeah. That’s really how it started. Since my management was based in London, most of my work started in Europe. And work begets work, and people hear what you’re doing, and they see you in performance, and all of that sort of thing. So that’s basically how my career stayed over there. Not to mention that there are so many more opera houses over there, and they more regularly do my repertory, rep of Wagner, Strauss, Berlioz, the big Verdi roles. That’s done a lot in Europe, whereas in America, because of budgets, it’s a very special thing and it’s not done as often. So I’m very happy to be back in Pittsburgh, and that Pittsburgh is doing some Wagner. It’s very exciting.”
CC:“We’re excited for it, too. It’s our first Wagner in 20 years.”
BR:“This opera in particular is a really good Wagner opera for people who are not used to Wagner. It’s one of his earlier pieces, and it’s in the Wagner Italianate style. You can hear some flashes of Verdi. You can hear some flashes of Donizetti. The storyline is really interesting. The music is beautiful. It’s not too long.”
CC:“What does the audience have to look forward to in this show?
BR:“The audience can look forward to an interesting story that has some contemporary applications. This story is so popular because it speaks to people. They’re able to relate it in some way to their lives. That is what propels the longevity and the popularity of the story. That’s number one. They can also look forward to beautiful music; they can look forward to really lush orchestration that they might not hear otherwise. It’s also something that you have to specifically be there live for. It’s not even the same when you listen to a recording. When I listen to a recording of Wagner, you can hear that it’s big. You can hear that it’s lush. You can tell that that’s what it is, but there’s no substitute for actually being there live. You can feel it. It’s visceral, it’s physical. And one of my old teachers, who studied and sang at Bayreuth, used to tell me, ‘It’s a psychological and emotional event. Every time you go to a Wagner opera, you’re being worked over, but you don’t realize it until you’re halfway through.’ And she is exactly right.
“Wagner was a genius at relaying emotion. He does it so much with the psychology and the emotion of the music and the text, that it affects you without it being spoken. I am very, very happy to be here. It’s a fantastic cast. The cast is very strong. It’s going to be a really good show.”

Home›Our Posts›‘The Barber of Seville’ a Bright 85th Season Opener
ByGeorge B ParousonOctober 15, 2023•(0)
By GEORGE B. PAROUS
Despite miserable weather and having a star baritone on the sick list,Pittsburgh Operaattracted a good-sized audience to a brilliant performance ofThe Barber of Seville(Il Barbiere di Siviglia)at the Benedum last evening. As is often the case, the tone of the evening was set byAntony Walkerand the orchestra “delivering” – and deliver they did, a superb rendition of Gioachino Rossini’s thrilling overture, some of the most inspired music in the classic, old, tuneful comedy. BaritoneJohn McCullough, the long-advertised singer who was to take the role of Figaro, the all-knowing barber of Seville, was unable to sing due to illness, but the company need not apologize for flying in – at the eleventh hour – the young, handsome and very giftedJohn Mooreto take his place. He has appeared in this production elsewhere, making for a test of his memory, and the little rehearsal time due to his last-minute arrival in Pittsburgh made his animated performance even more remarkable.
Moore has a rich, resonant voice and is an actor ideally suited to the part of Figaro. Despite a slightly clipped “Largo al factotum della città” (“Make way for the factotum of the city”), the role’s best-known aria, he gave a truly stellar rendition of the part, and with his voice and comedy gold, made a most auspicious debut with the company. The reception he received must surely have moved him deeply and made his unexpected trip worthwhile. Another baritone who gave a highly commendable performance, and, if memory serves, in his third appearance on the Pittsburgh Opera stage, was the versatileMusa Ngqungwana, who sings the role of Doctor Bartolo. His warmly burnished tones and naturally appealing stage presence make him a pleasure in any role he takes, be it tragedy or comedy. His extended range makes possible funny falsetto mockery in his Bartolo.
Stephanie Doche, also making her Pittsburgh Opera debut, has it all. Her velvety mezzo-soprano voice, her comedic acting skills and beautiful stage presence make for an excellent Rosina. Her resonant voice touches some of the higher tones with slightly less freedom than the rest of her range, which is negotiated with a secure loveliness, and her “business” and asides are engaging. She has an indescribably comic way of holding up her long skirts as she runs up and down stairways that happily occurs often. SopranoEmily Richter, as was to be expected, took the role of Berta and ran. She does the same thing with any role she takes. Her powerfully brilliant voice was in fine form and her schtick worked well. The voice and versatility of this young artist have been commented on at length before. And she seems to ripen with each new appearance.
Another new voice and face on the Benedum stage was tenorLunga Eric Hallam, as the Count Almaviva. He, too, made a striking appearance and is a vivid singing actor, though, at least last night, his voice was sometimes “white,” and some high tones were less than solidly focused. But the overall quality of his voice and the manner in which he uses it point to a very skilled artist.Brandon Bell, as Fiorello, had much to do with the performance getting off to the brilliant start that it did, and the always reliableBrian Kontes, both in singing and acting, was a notably fine Don Basilio.David ScovilleandRoy Simmonsrounded out the cast in the roles of an Officer and a Notary, respectively, and the chorus and “supes” all made fine showings.
As mentioned above,Antony Walkerand his orchestra delivered a marvelous performance. The overture was symphonic, and the conductor once again made the magic of the orchestration shine without taking anything away from the vocalists.Gregory Keller’sstage direction was clever and engaging, and for great singing, scenic design and many other points of interest, the opening night of Pittsburgh Opera’s 85th was a decidedly brilliant one indeed.
Three more performances remain, so for complete production details, plot summary, TICKETS and more, visitPittsburgh Opera. This is definitely a show you don’t want to miss.
NOTE:Due to the lack of a dress rehearsal with Mr. Moore, all of David Bachman’s accompanying photos were taken during the actual performance last evening.

Late-nineteenth-century Italy saw the emergence of verismo, a new operatic genre that told the stories of the lives of the poor and disenfranchised. Works by Puccini, Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Giordano and Francesco Cilea in that style are among the most popular operas in the repertoire. Contemporary writers and composers are equally inspired by today’s stories, which are finding a toehold in the repertoire.
This month, Pittsburgh Opera staged two contemporary operas, Philip Venables’sDenis & Katyaand Daniel Bernard Roumain’sWe Shall Not Be Moved,that are direct heirs to the verismo tradition. Instead of consumptive seamstresses, homicidal clowns, hot-blooded Sicilian peasants and the like, Venables and Roumain recast the stories of troubled teens adrift in contemporary society. The results are as riveting as they are disturbing – all the more so because both works are rooted in actual events.
The operas premiered at Opera Philadelphia –We Shall Not Be Movedin 2016 andDenis & Katyain 2019 – and Pittsburgh has imported the productions. Bill T. Jones is again on board as director and choreographer forWe Shall Not Be Moved,while Ted Huffman’s concept forDenis & Katyahas been faithfully reproduced by Haley Stamats, a Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist.
Denis & Katyais based on the true story of two Russian teenagers. It is a modern-day version of Shakespeare’sRomeo and Julietin which parental disapproval prompts two fifteen-year olds to flee to a cabin in the town of Strugi Krasnye. The livestream of their standoff with Russian Special Forces and their eventual suicides on 14 November 2016 became an internet sensation.
Huffman’s libretto combines eye-witness accounts of the tragedy with fictionalized material based on media reports and interviews with Denis’s best friend. Text messages from online viewers as well as the press chasing a story are projected throughout the 65-minute opera. Venables’s score is as taut and powerful as the story itself.
In its final minutes, video footage of a train departing from the town is projected, and the teens’ friends, family and community are left to deal with the incident’s aftermath. Media interest in the story fades, and the story of Denis and Katya is replaced by one of a man who has killed his wife and kids.
The entire two-act opera is performed in the confines of a white box with low walls. Four cellists sit in the corners of the enclosure. Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artists Brandon Bell and Jazmine Olwalia take on the roles of multiple characters – Journalist, Teacher, Friend, Teenager and Medic – in 112 scenes. Two of the characters, the neighbor whose windows are shot out by Denis and his best friend, are sung in Russian.
Bell and Olwalia are both excellent storytellers. Olwalia’s rapid-fire delivery of the excitable neighbor’s exclamations are matched by the athleticism required as she runs about the stage and jumps on the walls. Bell, on the other hand, has to create the character mostly through voice alone, and his resonant baritone is equal to the task. The four cellists – Kathleen Mellucci, Paula Tuttle, Joseph Bishkoff, Jr. and Katya Janpoladyan – were also characters in the drama.
The first Pittsburgh performance ofWe Shall Not Be Movedwas on 13 May,which was also the 38th anniversary of the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia. In an attempt to resolve a standoff with MOVE, a black liberation organization, the Philadelphia police dropped two explosive devices on a house occupied by the group. The fire burned out of control and destroyed 61 homes, leaving 260 people homeless and resulting in the deaths of six adults and five children. Of the people in the house, only one adult and a single child survived.
Librettist Marc Bamuthi Joseph does not retell the story of the MOVE tragedy, but rather uses it as the backdrop for five teenagers who have formed a family to survive. There is enough information on the MOVE bombing to provide context, and the recorded voice of Pat Ciarrocchi, a Philadelphia television anchor and journalist who covered the 1985 incident, adds authenticity.
The youths, who are either people of color or identify as such, are scarred by the senseless violence and a system that has failed them. After one of the group kills a man, they flee to West Philadelphia to begin afresh, taking refuge in the derelict house that was built on the site of the MOVE house in the 1985 incident. Violence begets violence, and they end up holding Glenda, a member of the Philadelphia police force, whose life tragically intersects with the lives of the five teens on many levels.
Bill T. Jones’s staging is as bold as the story he tells. The set is relatively simple: buildings are outlined on white scrims that fold to create a structure with stained glass windows. It is a holy place, a shrine to those who perished in the fire, whose spirits haunt the place and reach out to its new inhabitants. Projections of flames show the MOVE house consumed by fire. Movement and dance are an integral part of Jones’s concept.
Alexa Patrick’s Un/Sung, who is the de facto head of the family, is bold, brash and defiant. Her cry of ‘Who cries for the brown girl?’ resonates throughout the opera. It also fuels her confrontation with Kirstin Chávez’s Glenda, a woman of color who escaped despair and violence to become a figure of authority. Glenda is the most complex character of the opera, and Chávez captured her pride, humanity and vulnerability.
The other members of the family are as diverse as the music created for them. John Holliday’s sweet countertenor lent innocence to the trans teen John Blue. Chance Jonas-O’Toole’s John Little was a pugnacious punk with a clear tenor as penetrating as his character’s defiance. Ron Dukes’s resonant bass was as exuberant as John Henry’s macho man, who viewed his body as a gift to womankind. Adam Richardson’s bible-toting John Mack was the family’s spiritual anchor, his baritone as comforting as it was smooth.
Viswa Subbaraman was a stylistic chameleon, as was the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra, in channeling the dynamism and diversity of musical styles in Daniel Bernard Roumain’s score. The sinuous movements of Indira Cunningham, Simon Phillips, Ethan Gwynn and Ira Cambric III haunted the performance as the ghosts of the MOVE family that died in May 1985.
Jones briefly addressed the audience during the curtain calls forWe Shall Not Be Movedand thanked Pittsburgh Opera for having the courage to present the opera. The sad fact is that the needle has not moved a notch on the issues and challenges facing today’s youth since the two operas were conceived and premiered. It’s just harder to speak the truth about them. That is where the bravery comes in.

I completed the survey that came in my email but forgot to comment on the music and the spoken word. It was all fantastic. I really enjoyed the music and the ‘hip-hop’ theme associated with the dance. The music was haunting. Bill T. Jones is a genius and the orchestra conductor was great! Thank you.
