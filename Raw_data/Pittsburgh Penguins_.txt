[CONTENT] : FacturaciÃ³n y pago.
[CONTENT] : Impuestos sobre las ventas.Â Para determinadas compras realizadas a travÃ©s de los Servicios, las Entidades de la NHL (o, en los casos en los que corresponda, sus Proveedores de servicios) deben cobrar impuestos sobre las ventas (incluido el impuesto sobre el valor agregado aplicable). En estados o regiones que cobran impuestos sobre las ventas o el uso, la compra estÃ¡ sujeta al impuesto a menos que estÃ© especÃ­ficamente exenta. Las compras de los Servicios no estÃ¡n exentas de los impuestos sobre las ventas o el uso simplemente porque se hagan desde Internet o porque las Entidades de la NHL no tengan la obligaciÃ³n por parte de algÃºn estado o regiÃ³n en particular de cobrar impuestos sobre las ventas. El cobro de los impuestos sobre las ventas en una determinada compra y el monto del impuesto cobrado dependen de varios factores, entre los que se incluye si el vendedor estÃ¡ presente en una jurisdicciÃ³n dada. El comprador es responsable de los impuestos aplicables que no sean cobrados por las Entidades de NHL, y algunos estados requieren que los compradores presenten una declaraciÃ³n de impuestos sobre las ventas/uso, en la que se informen las compras gravables por las cuales las Entidades de la NHL no hayan realizado el cobro del impuesto, y que paguen dicho impuesto. Para obtener mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n, consulte el sitio web de la autoridad tributaria aplicable o comunÃ­quese con ella de alguna otra forma. Si las Entidades de la NHL cobraran un impuesto sobre las ventas relacionado con una compra, dicho monto se mostrarÃ¡ ya sea antes de la finalizaciÃ³n de la compra o en la confirmaciÃ³n final de la compra.

Si la parte que recibe la NotificaciÃ³n de Conflicto solicita una conferencia telefÃ³nica para llegar a un acuerdo como parte de este proceso informal, usted y la NHL aceptan participar en un esfuerzo para resolver el Conflicto. En caso de que la NHL hiciera esta solicitud, usted acepta asistir a esta conferencia (con su abogado, en caso de contar con representaciÃ³n legal). En caso de que usted haga esta solicitud, la NHL accede a que un representante asista a esta conferencia (con abogado, en caso de que la NHL estÃ© representada).
[CONTENT] : El cumplimiento de este "Proceso informal obligatorio para la resoluciÃ³n previa de conflictos" es una condiciÃ³n previa al inicio del arbitraje. Ni usted ni la NHL pueden iniciar un proceso de arbitraje en la ausencia de este requisito. En caso de cuestionarse la suficiencia de la NotificaciÃ³n de Conflicto o del cumplimiento de este proceso, podrÃ¡ decidirlo un tribunal de jurisdicciÃ³n competente a elecciÃ³n de cualquiera de las dos partes y se suspenderÃ¡ el procedimiento de arbitraje. Dicho tribunal tendrÃ¡ la autoridad suficiente para hacer cumplir esta condiciÃ³n previa a un proceso de arbitraje, lo cual incluye la facultad de prohibir la presentaciÃ³n o tramitaciÃ³n de una demanda de arbitraje y la determinaciÃ³n y el cobro de los gastos administrativos de arbitraje. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cada parte puede optar por plantear el incumplimiento de este Proceso informal obligatorio para la resoluciÃ³n previa de conflictos y solicitar una reparaciÃ³n mediante el arbitraje.

[CONTENT] : *Â Procedimientos de arbitraje.*
[CONTENT] : Salvo que se disponga lo contrario en el presente documento, todo Conflicto que no sea resuelto mediante el Proceso informal obligatorio para la resoluciÃ³n previa de conflictos o el tribunal de demandas de menor cuantÃ­a, deberÃ¡ resolverse mediante el arbitraje vinculante que se celebrarÃ¡ en el condado o distrito donde usted resida.
[CONTENT] : El arbitraje serÃ¡ administrado por la American Arbitration Association (AsociaciÃ³n Americana de Arbitraje) ("AAA") y un solo Ã¡rbitro neutral se ocuparÃ¡ de decidir el caso. La AAA administrarÃ¡ el arbitraje de acuerdo con las normas correspondientes de la AAA incluidas las normas complementarias ("Normas de la AAA"), modificadas por los presentes tÃ©rminos. Las Normas de la AAA estÃ¡n disponibles enÂwww.adr.org. Si la AAA no puede o no quiere administrar el arbitraje de acuerdo con estos TÃ©rminos, las partes acordarÃ¡n un proveedor alternativo que lo haga. Si las partes no llegan a un acuerdo, solicitarÃ¡n conjuntamente a un tribunal competente que designe un proveedor de arbitraje que lo haga.
[CONTENT] : La parte que desee iniciar el arbitraje deberÃ¡ proporcionar a la otra parte la demanda de arbitraje tal como se especifica en las Normas de la AAA y en estas disposiciones de arbitraje. Si usted va a iniciar un arbitraje, deberÃ¡ proporcionar la demanda a la NHL por medio del correo electrÃ³nico a[email protected]Si la NHL inicia el arbitraje, la NHL le enviarÃ¡ la demanda a la direcciÃ³n de correo que ha registrado anteriormente.

El Ã¡rbitro tiene la autorizaciÃ³n para otorgar las reparaciones o imponer las sanciones disponibles segÃºn las Normas Federales de Procedimientos Civiles 11 o de conformidad con lo dispuesto en la ley federal o estatal aplicable en contra de la o las personas que correspondan (incluidos abogados) como sucederÃ­a en un tribunal.
[CONTENT] : Las Normas de la AAA regirÃ¡n el pago de todos los gastos de arbitraje. Usted y la NHL acuerdan que el arbitraje sea diseÃ±ado para ser econÃ³micamente viable para todas las partes. Ambas partes pueden colaborar con la AAA para hablar de reducciones en las tarifas y pagos diferidos. Todas las cuestiones deberÃ¡n ser resueltas por el Ã¡rbitro, exceptuando las siguientes, que deberÃ¡n ser resueltas por un tribunal con jurisdicciÃ³n competente: (1) cuestiones especÃ­ficamente reservadas para un tribunal en estos TÃ©rminos y (2) cuestiones relacionadas con el alcance y la aplicabilidad de las disposiciones del arbitraje.
[CONTENT] : El Ã¡rbitro puede otorgar compensaciones, por ejemplo, entre otras, compensaciones monetarias, declaratorias, medidas cautelares o cualquier otra compensaciÃ³n equivalente solo a favor de la parte que solicite la compensaciÃ³n y solo al en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la compensaciÃ³n justificada por la reclamaciÃ³n individual de dicha parte. El Ã¡rbitro debe atenerse a estos TÃ©rminos y otorgar las mismas indemnizaciones por daÃ±os y perjuicios y compensaciones individualizadas que un tribunal, incluidas las medidas cautelares u otras compensaciones equitativas necesarias para proporcionar una reparaciÃ³n de la reclamaciÃ³n individualizada. Una vez dictado el laudo, el Ã¡rbitro aplicarÃ¡ las disposiciones sobre reparto de costos de la Norma Federal de Procedimiento Civil 68. A menos que usted y la NHL acuerden algo diferente, las reclamaciones de una persona no podrÃ¡n consolidarse con las de ninguna otra persona. Si un tribunal determina que no se puede renunciar a una reclamaciÃ³n o solicitud de medidas cautelares pÃºblicas y se han agotado todos los recursos para esta decisiÃ³n (o es una decisiÃ³n definitiva), usted y la NHL acuerdan que toda reclamaciÃ³n o solicitud de medidas cautelares pÃºblicas se suspenda y sea resuelta por un tribunal en espera de un arbitraje de las reclamaciones y las solicitudes de compensaciÃ³n restantes.
[CONTENT] : Las decisiones del Ã¡rbitro deben estar por escrito y deben exponer los hechos esenciales y los anÃ¡lisis legales. La decisiÃ³n del Ã¡rbitro se dictarÃ¡ por escrito y en ella se expondrÃ¡n las principales conclusiones de hecho y el anÃ¡lisis jurÃ­dico. Un tribunal de jurisdicciÃ³n competente puede dictar una sentencia para ejecutar el laudo; sin embargo, un laudo que haya sido satisfecho no podrÃ¡ presentarse ni registrarse en un tribunal. La decisiÃ³n del Ã¡rbitro no deberÃ¡ tener efecto preclusivo en ningÃºn procedimiento en el que intervengan partes no idÃ©nticas.
[CONTENT] : Cada parte se reserva el derecho a solicitar al Ã¡rbitro una audiencia telefÃ³nica, por video, o en persona. Usted y el representante de la NHL deberÃ¡n asistir personalmente a la audiencia ordenada por el Ã¡rbitro (junto con su abogado y los abogados de la NHL, en caso de estar representados). En caso de reclamaciones mayores que $25,000 (y reclamaciones en las que se soliciten medidas cautelares equitativas o declaratorias individualizadas que no estÃ¡n sujetas al tribunal de demandas de menor cuantÃ­a como se ha indicado anteriormente), se deberÃ¡ llevar a cabo una audiencia vÃ­a telefÃ³nica, virtual o en persona y usted y los representantes de la NHL deberÃ¡n asistir personalmente (junto con su abogado y los abogados de la NHL, en caso de estar representados) Las partes pueden acordar renunciar a la audiencia.

Si se presentan cincuenta (50) o mÃ¡s reclamaciones similares contra la NHL por el mismo abogado o por abogados coordinados o que se coordinen de alguna otra manera (y su reclamaciÃ³n es una de ellas), usted entiende y acepta que se aplicarÃ¡n estos procedimientos adicionales y que la resoluciÃ³n de su Conflicto podrÃ­a retrasarse.
[CONTENT] : Los perÃ­odos de prescripciÃ³n pertinentes y los honorarios de presentaciÃ³n y otros plazos se suspenderÃ¡n sujeto a estos Procedimientos adicionales para la presentaciÃ³n de mÃºltiples casos desde el momento en que se seleccionen los primeros casos para un proceso por etapas hasta que su reclamaciÃ³n sea seleccionada para proceder como parte de un proceso por etapas o se resuelva, retire, resuelva de alguna otra manera o se excluya de arbitraje.Un tribunal de jurisdicciÃ³n competente tendrÃ¡ la autoridad para hacer cumplir estos Procedimientos adicionales para la presentaciÃ³n de mÃºltiples casos y, de ser necesario, para impedir la presentaciÃ³n, procesamiento o administraciÃ³n masiva de los arbitrajes y la determinaciÃ³n y cobro de los gastos de arbitraje.

[CONTENT] : Â Ââ¢ No participar en futuros cambios.

[CONTENT] : Arbitration Procedures.
[CONTENT] : Except as otherwise provided herein, any Dispute that is not resolved through the Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process or small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the county or parish in which you reside.
[CONTENT] : The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and heard by a single, neutral arbitrator. The AAA shall administer the arbitration in accordance with the AAA's applicable rules including the supplementary rules ("AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available atwww.adr.org. If the AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with these Terms, the parties shall agree on an alternative provider that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration provider that will do so.
[CONTENT] : The party seeking to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with the demand for arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules and these arbitration provisions. If you are initiating arbitration, you shall serve the demand on the NHL by email to[email protected]. If the NHL is initiating arbitration, the NHL shall serve the demand at the email address that we have on file for you. The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By signing the demand for arbitration, that party (and their counsel, if represented) certifies that they have complied with (1) the Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process (and they shall attach the Notice of Dispute) and (2) the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including that the claims and relief sought are neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to award any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate persons (including counsel) as a court would.
[CONTENT] : The AAA Rules shall govern the payment of all arbitration fees. You and the NHL agree that arbitration is designed to be cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the AAA to discuss fee reductions and deferred payments. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide except the following, which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide: (1) issues that are specifically reserved for a court in these Terms and (2) issues related to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provisions.
[CONTENT] : The arbitrator may award relief, including, but not limited to, monetary, declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same individualized damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief necessary to provide relief as to the individualized claim. The arbitrator shall apply the cost-shifting provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of an award. Unless you and the NHL otherwise agree, one person's claims may not be consolidated with those of any other person. If a court determines that a claim or request for public injunctive relief may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or it is otherwise final), you and the NHL agree that any claim or request for public injunctive relief shall be stayed and resolved by a court pending arbitration of the remaining claims and requests for relief.
[CONTENT] : The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall set forth the essential findings of fact and legal analysis. A judgment to enforce the award may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, however, any award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall have no preclusive effect in any proceeding involving non-identical parties.
[CONTENT] : Each party reserves the right to request a telephonic, video, or in-person hearing from the arbitrator. You and the NHL's representative shall personally appear at any hearing ordered by the arbitrator (along with your and the NHL's counsel, if represented). For claims of more than $25,000 (and for claims seeking individualized injunctive, equitable, or declaratory relief that are not subject to small claims court as set forth above), a telephone, virtual, or in-person hearing shall be held and you and the NHL's representative shall personally appear (along with your and the NHL's counsel, if represented). The parties can agree to waive a hearing.
[CONTENT] : Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings.
[CONTENT] : The following provisions set forth additional procedures that apply to multiple case filings. If fifty (50) or more similar claims are asserted against the NHL by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your claim is one of them), you understand and agree that these additional procedures shall apply and the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.
[CONTENT] : Each case within any given stage shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process set forth above, either:
[CONTENT] : OR
[CONTENT] : Any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled subject to these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings from the time the first cases are selected for a staged process until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.
[CONTENT] : A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment and collection of arbitration fees. If these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms.
[CONTENT] : â¢ Opt Out of Future Changes.
[CONTENT] : If the NHL makes any future change to the arbitration provisions in this Section 18 (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending the NHL a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes by email to[email protected]within thirty (30) days of notice of the change and include your full name and your mailing address, telephone number, and email address, and a description of when and how you interacted with the NHL. Such opt out must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the arbitration provisions.This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.
[CONTENT] : Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver.
[CONTENT] : PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC).
[CONTENT] : You and the NHL agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and the NHL may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and the NHL may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or the NHL may participate in a class-wide settlement.
[CONTENT] : To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the NHL waive any right to a jury trial.
[CONTENT] : Choice of Law and Venue.
