## About us
The Pittsburgh Taco Festival츽춽is an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the city칙춫s Latin-American community.
## history
The Original Pittsburgh Taco Festival츽춽was founded in 2016 by Craig McCloud who sought to create an opportunity which benefitted food trucks/start-ups as well as support non-profits that serve the city칙춫s burgeoning Latin American population. The festival regularly attracts vendors from beyond the metro area, as well as visitors who plan weekend visits from New York, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, and beyond. Over the years, tens of thousands of people have joined us for what has become an annually anticipated cultural and community event. We hope you칙춫ll join us, too!
