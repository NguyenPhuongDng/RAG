## Content:
Join us for the first installment of a four-part lecture series with the Smithsonian.
Blast off into the world of space exploration, innovation, and history with Dr. Margaret Weitekamp, chair of the Space History Department at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.
Dr. Weitekamp will explore how museums collect and document space history, with a special focus on the Apollo Program. Using the powerful metaphor of cathedral-building—where the generation that lays the foundation never sees the final structure—she will discuss how preserving space history is a long-term mission.
She will also go behind-the-scenes of the groundbreaking Smithsonian exhibit,Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission,on view at the History Center from September 2018 through February 2019, and discuss how the museum helped curate a local section of this interstellar project.
Dr. Weitekamp’s award-winning book, “Space Craze: America’s Enduring Fascination with Real and Imagined Spaceflight,” will be available for purchase at the program. She will sign copies for attendees following the talk.
Don’t miss this opportunity to embark on a space deep dive. Book your boarding pass today.
Reserve Tickets
Tickets are $10 for non-members and $5 for members. This is a hybrid program. Attendees can participate in-person at the Heinz History Center or online.
American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation will be available upon request. Please contact us at[email protected]in advance to request accommodations.
The Smithsonian Lecture Series brings experts from the Smithsonian Institution to Pittsburgh, presenting a unique opportunity to hear from the scholars behind the organization’s world-renowned research and museum exhibitions.
While each lecture will focus on a different topic, each expert will offer rare insights into how they preserve, collect, and interpret history at the world’s largest museum, education, and research institution.
As Western Pennsylvania’s only Smithsonian Affiliate, the Heinz History Center proudly brings world-class Smithsonian exhibitions, artifacts, and programs to the region. This special lecture series is part of that ongoing partnership.
Dr. Margaret A. Weitekamp serves as chair for the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum, and curates the Museum’s social and cultural history of spaceflight collection, more than 5,000 artifacts that include both space memorabilia and space science fiction objects. These everyday mementos of the space age—which include toys and games, medals and awards, buttons and pins, as well as comics and trading cards—complete the story about spaceflight told by the Museum’s collection of space hardware and technologies.
Her book, “Space Craze: America’s Enduring Fascination with Real and Imagined Spaceflight (2022),” is directly based on that work. Space Craze has been recognized with a Secretary’s Research Prize from the Smithsonian Institution, and the 2024 Gardner-Lasser Aerospace History Literature Award from the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).
With Matthew Shindell, she revised and expanded “Spaceships: An Illustrated History of the Real and Imagined (2023).” She is the author of numerous scholarly articles as well as “Right Stuff, Wrong Sex: America’s First Women in Space Program,” which won the Eugene M. Emme Award for Astronautical Literature from the American Astronautical Society. In addition, she wrote an award-winning children’s picture book “Pluto’s Secret: An Icy World’s Tale of Discovery,” in collaboration with David DeVorkin, with illustrations by Diane Kidd. Her newest project is a comparative study of 21st century renovations of science and technology museums around the world. She’s also exploring the material history of the space monkey, Able, from 1959.
Weitekamp earned a BA from the University of Pittsburgh and an MA and PhD in history from Cornell University. During her graduate work, she was a Mellon fellow in the humanities and spent a year in residence at the NASA Headquarters History Office in Washington, D.C. as the American Historical Association / NASA Aerospace History Fellow.

Even in this land of opportunity, life is made up of hard work with meager pay. Like so many others, Ferro’s grandmother had to take in boarders to help pay the rent.
When a nun at the Catholic school realizes that Ferro’s mother has serious musical talent and suggests the child take piano lessons, Grandma Vittoria, tells her that they cannot possibly pay for lessons. So, the sister offers to give Giovanna piano lessons in exchange for Vittoria’s homemade Italian bread. And thus begins the musical life of this family that has been gifted with a beautiful talent they will come to share with the world.
But it is their Italian heritage and the love and respect they have for their traditions, their families and friends that comes shining through in good times and in bad. All of this and the simple teaching of gratitude—always gratitude—as the author looks back and sees how her grandmother’s simple loaves of homemade bread, “Just like the Bible story where Jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes… multiplied blessings of musical talents that would affect many generations to come.”
Mary Ferro was born and raised in Carnegie, Pa. A graduate of Carlynton High School and Duquesne University’s School of Music, she began her piano studies at age 7. She studied with her mother Jane Ferro, Patricia Jaynes (formerly of Carnegie Mellon University and Chatham College), and Beverly Nero of Duquesne University. Ferro also studied under the internationally known vocal coach, Professor Lorenzo Malfatti, who worked with Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli.
Her talent for the piano became evident at age 12 when she began performing as keyboardist with her twin brother Vince, a guitarist. Ferro has served as a professional pianist in various capacities, from accompanist to Keyboard 1 in High School Musicals, Keyboardist in Classic Rock Bands and as a church musician. She was the musical director of the international performing folk group I Campagnoli, directed by her mother Jane P. Ferro. This troupe performed throughout the United States and Europe.
Ferro is the former Music Educator from the Carlynton School District and was employed as Choral Director and General Music Instructor. Outside of the music world, she was a broadcaster for WDUQ 90.5FM for two years as the host of the radio show, “Rock Before Your Ears.” Her love of music, does not exclude a sense of humor. Some of her Comedienne appearances: The Howie Mandel Talk Show, America’s Funniest People, WOR Radio N.Y.C., and RudeTube, London, England Y97 with Jimmy and Steve.

Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878)  
The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh.

KDKA transmitter, c. 1921 
In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast.

This replica transmitter retains some parts from Frank Conrad’s original, which is credited with the first commercial radio broadcast.

## Content:
The Senator John Heinz History Center is Pennsylvania’s largest history museum and a proud affiliate of theSmithsonian Institution. Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives.
Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection.
This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs.
The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania.
In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years.
Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections.
The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today.
Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District.
With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions.
Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission.
In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage.
As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep.
The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region’s passion for amateur and professional sports.
The Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania’s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh.
Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, is located in Avella, Washington County, Pa. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, features 19,000-year-old evidence of the region’s earliest inhabitants under a massive rock overhang. In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years.
More than 250 years of our region’s history can be found at the Thomas and Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Founded in 1879, the Library & Archives’ collections are accessible to researchers, students, and the general public.
The History Center recently earned the coveted 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for sound fiscal management and commitment to accountability and transparency, so you can be confident that your donation is going to a great place.

## Content:
The Heinz History Center actively seeks collections and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present.
If you have objects, photographs, artwork, digital material, or documents that you believe would be of potential interest to our collection, we would like to hear from you. To start the donation process, please tell us about your materials by filling out anCollection Donation Form.
The more information provided about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania, the easier it is for our Collections Committee to assess. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is also appreciated.
Donate to the Collection
For additional questions or information, please email[email protected].
Please use onour online formto offer historic materials.
Please do not bring materials to the History Center without an appointment.
Tell us anything you know about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania. For example, you might explain who owned them and when or how they were used or why they were produced. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is appreciated. The material will then be assessed by our Collections Committee and you will be notified of their decision.
Materials that document the lives of Western Pennsylvanians and the history of the region up to and including the present. Historic materials can take many forms, such as personal letters, business records, uniforms, tools, local souvenirs, paintings of Western Pennsylvania, published books or family scrapbooks, hand-made quilts, and Pittsburgh manufactured products. The most important criterion for donation is that the materials say something about this region. It is important to provide as much detail as you can about the articles you wish to donate, this will help the Collections Committee make a more informed decision.
We cannot accept everything. Organizing, cataloging, and preserving historical materials for the future takes so much space, time, and money, that donations must be selected very carefully. Staff review each offer and compare it with what we already have in the collection, they assess its condition and determine what it tells us about life in Western Pennsylvania. Normally, objects and artwork need to be seen before a decision can be made.
Unless we designate your materials for a specific exhibit, they will not be put on display immediately. What you see at the History Center is only a very small part of the collections. That is because we have limited gallery space and because long-term display can have negative effects on preservation. The rest are carefully catalogued and stored in a temperature controlled environment so that they will be available for future exhibits at the History Center, for loan to other museums, or for research and reference for generations to come.
Please do nothing to the items. We prefer to see them in their original condition. Do not clean, repaint, refinish, or “spruce up” historical materials before giving them to us. Please provide as much related historical information as possible. For example, if you plan to offer your grandfather’s report card, you might also offer photographs of him as a student, samples of his school papers and the cap he wore at school. If you have photographs it is helpful to make copies and identify the people and locations in the images.
Documents, photographs and published materials are available for research and reference in the Detre Library & Archives at the History Center duringregular hours. Requests to see artwork and objects should be made to the collections manager at 412-454-6434. Please give our curators and archivists at least two weeks advance notice.
Yes. The donor is responsible for determining and documenting the value of a donation. Staff at the History Center cannot appraise materials. They can give you a list of certified appraisers.
Materials are not accepted on long term loan, nor can agreements be made to return materials to heirs. Occasionally, short term loans for specific exhibits are accepted. The Deed of Gift, signed by every donor, gives the History Center clear ownership of the materials. The History Center accepts responsibility for preserving each donation for generations to come.
Yes. Please contact us and let us know of the planned bequest. We appreciate having the opportunity to learn the story behind the materials. We can also explain in further detail the appropriate phrasing for your documents. Please note, bequests must meet collections requirements.
Each item or collection is different, but factors that contribute to the decision include, but are not limited to, its historical or cultural significance to the Western Pennsylvania region, physical condition, whether or not the museum already owns a similar item or copy, and its ownership history.
With limited space and resources, our interest is in building the collection where gaps exist or in area of particular interest. In general, we are not interested in adding items that duplicate those already in the collection. You can search the Library & Archives holdingshere.
Each item or collection that is donated is assigned a unique number and entered into the online catalog. Depending on the size of a collection, more work might need to be done prior to it being accessible to the public. This includes, but limited to, organizing, re-housing materials in acid-free folders, addressing minor preservation needs, and writing afinding aidto the collection.
Very rarely does the Detre Library & Archives purchase a collection. On these occasions, we cannot suggest or set a purchase price. This must be set by the seller.
For assistance in identifying historical materials or learning more about them, please email[email protected]. While we do not provide appraisals, our team can suggest ways to locate certified appraisers.

The Cornerstone is a podcast connecting Jewish historical sites in Western Pennsylvania to historic materials in the Rauh Jewish History Program & Archives. Each episode investigates one spot in the region. It might be a synagogue, a schoolhouse, a work of public art, a gravestone, or something as subtle as a painted-over mezuzah. The story of each spot is told through documents, photographs and oral histories, all of which can be studied in greater depth with interactive StoryMaps. The Cornerstone is made possible through a grant from the SteelTree Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.

The Meadowcroft Rockshelter is known around the world as an important North American archaeological site and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.
In addition to his work at Meadowcroft, Dr. Adovasio has excavated at locations around the world and he is recognized as a global authority on perishable materials such as ancient basketry and textiles. He is the author of multiple books including “The First Americans: In Pursuit of Archaeology’s Greatest Mystery” (Random House, 2002), “The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory” (Harper Collins, 2007), and his latest, “Strangers in a New Land” (Firefly Books Ltd., 2016), which documents 35 of the earliest sites in North and South America. He received his B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Arizona, his Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of Utah, and completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution.
